abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper illustrates how Semantic Web technologies (especially RDF, OWL, and SPARQL) can support information integration and make it easy to create semantic mashups (semantically integrated resources). In the context of understanding the genetic basis of nicotine dependence, we integrate gene and pathway information and show how three complex biological queries can be answered by the integrated knowledge base.

METHODS: We use an ontology-driven approach to integrate two gene resources (Entrez Gene and HomoloGene) and three pathway resources (KEGG, Reactome and BioCyc), for five organisms, including humans. We created the Entrez Knowledge Model (EKoM), an information model in OWL for the gene resources, and integrated it with the extant BioPAX ontology designed for pathway resources. The integrated schema is populated with data from the pathway resources, publicly available in BioPAX-compatible format, and gene resources for which a population procedure was created. The SPARQL query language is used to formulate queries over the integrated knowledge base to answer the three biological queries.

RESULTS: Simple SPARQL queries could easily identify hub genes, i.e., those genes whose gene products participate in many pathways or interact with many other gene products. The identification of the genes expressed in the brain turned out to be more difficult, due to the lack of a common identification scheme for proteins.

CONCLUSION: Semantic Web technologies provide a valid framework for information integration in the life sciences. Ontology-driven integration represents a flexible, sustainable and extensible solution to the integration of large volumes of information. Additional resources, which enable the creation of mappings between information sources, are required to compensate for heterogeneity across namespaces.

@article{Han2010,
abstract = {Plants challenged by pathogens, especially necrotrophic fungi such as Botrytis cinerea, produce high levels of ethylene. At present, the signaling pathways underlying the induction of ethylene after pathogen infection are largely unknown. MPK6, an Arabidopsis stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was previously shown to regulate the stability of ACS2 and ACS6, two type I ACS isozymes (1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase). Phosphorylation of ACS2 and ACS6 by MPK6 prevents rapid degradation of ACS2/ACS6 by the 26S proteasome pathway, resulting in an increase in cellular ACS activity and ethylene biosynthesis. Here, we show that MPK3, which shares high homology and common upstream MAPK kinases with MPK6, is also capable of phosphorylating ACS2 and ACS6. In the mpk3 mutant background, ethylene production in gain-of-function GVG-NtMEK2(DD) transgenic plants was compromised, suggesting that MPK6 and MPK3 function together to stabilize ACS2 and ACS6. Using a liquid-cultured seedling system, we found that B. cinerea-induced ethylene biosynthesis was greatly compromised in mpk3/mpk6 double mutant seedlings. In contrast, ethylene production decreased only slightly in the mpk6 single mutant and not at all in the mpk3 single mutant, demonstrating overlapping roles for these two highly homologous MAPKs in pathogen-induced ethylene induction. Consistent with the role of MPK3/MPK6 in the process, mutation of ACS2 and ACS6, two genes encoding downstream substrates of MPK3/MPK6, also reduced B. cinerea-induced ethylene production. The residual levels of ethylene induction in the acs2/acs6 double mutant suggest the involvement of additional ACS isoforms, possibly regulated by MAPK-independent pathway(s).},

abstract = {Rodent cells are used widely to manufacture recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical use in humans and animals. However, all rodent cell lines express endogenous retroviruses that require appropriate testing regimes for identification and characterisation. In this communication we report the results of transmission electron microscopy, reverse transcriptase assay and infectious virus assays for retrovirus in 185 manufacturer cell banks of mouse, rat or hamster origin. The results indicated considerable variability of retroviral expression levels by transmission electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase assay, but nevertheless characteristic features of each cell type were observed. Infectious retrovirus was detected in mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines, but not in cell lines of hamster or rat origin. There was no evidence of contamination of cell banks with exogenous retrovirus. The results of retroviral characterisation of the parental mouse cell lines NS0, NS-1 and Sp2/0Ag14 by the above assays were consistent with the results of the survey. Co-cultivation of the above parental mouse cell lines with mouse and human cell lines suggested that the ability to infect human cells was related to threshold susceptibility of cell types and the levels of expression of infectious xenotropic retrovirus by mouse cells.},

abstract = {The CDKN2A locus encodes two distinct proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, both of which are implicated in replicative senescence and tumor suppression in different contexts. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel strain of human diploid fibroblasts (designated Milan HDFs) from an individual who is homozygous for the R24P mutation in p16INK4a. As this mutation occurs in the first exon of INK4a (exon 1alpha), it has no effect on the primary sequence of p14(ARF). Based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the R24P variant is specifically defective for binding to CDK4 but remains able to associate with CDK6. Nevertheless, Milan HDFs behave as if they are p16INK4a deficient, in terms of sensitivity to spontaneous and oncogene-induced senescence, and the R24P variant has little effect on proliferation when ectopically expressed in normal fibroblasts. It can, however, impair the proliferation of U20S cells, presumably because they express more CDK6 than primary fibroblasts. These observations suggest that CDK4 and CDK6 are not functionally redundant and underscore the importance of CDK4 in the development of melanoma.},

@article{Ron2004,
abstract = {An ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX) is a potent elicitor of plant defense responses in specific cultivars of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). The LeEix locus in tomatoes was characterized by map-based cloning, which led to the identification of a novel gene cluster from which two members (LeEix1 and LeEix2) were isolated. Similar to the tomato Ve resistance genes in tomato plants, the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by LeEix1 and LeEix2 contain a Leu zipper, an extracellular Leu-rich repeat domain with glycosylation signals, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal domain with a mammalian endocytosis signal. Silencing expression of the LeEix genes prevented the binding of EIX to cells of an EIX-responsive plant and thus inhibited the hypersensitive response. Overexpression of either LeEix1 or LeEix2 genes in EIX-nonresponsive tobacco plants enabled the binding of EIX, although only LeEix2 could transmit the signal that induced the hypersensitive response. Overexpressing LeEix2 in mammalian COS-7 cells enables binding of EIX, indicating physical interaction between the EIX elicitor and LeEix2 gene product. Structural analysis of the LeEix proteins suggests that they belong to a class of cell-surface glycoproteins with a signal for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Mutating the endocytosis signal in LeEix2 (Tyr 993 to Ala) abolished its ability to induce the hypersensitive response, suggesting that endocytosis plays a key role in the signal transduction pathway.},

@article{Schulze2010,
abstract = {In plants leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) located at the plasma membrane play a pivotal role in the perception of extracellular signals. For two of these LRR-RKs, the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 and the flagellin receptor FLS2, interaction with the LRR receptor-like kinase BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) was shown to be required for signal transduction. Here we report that FLS2.BAK1 heteromerization occurs almost instantaneously after perception of the ligand, the flagellin-derived peptide flg22. Flg22 can induce formation of a stable FLS2.BAK1 complex in microsomal membrane preparations in vitro, and the kinase inhibitor K-252a does not prevent complex formation. A kinase dead version of BAK1 associates with FLS2 in a flg22-dependent manner but does not restore responsiveness to flg22 in cells of bak1 plants, demonstrating that kinase activity of BAK1 is essential for FLS2 signaling. Furthermore, using in vivo phospholabeling, we are able to detect de novo phosphorylation of both FLS2 and BAK1 within 15 s of stimulation with flg22. Similarly, brassinolide induces BAK1 phosphorylation within seconds. Other triggers of plant defense, such as bacterial EF-Tu and the endogenous AtPep1 likewise induce rapid formation of heterocomplexes consisting of de novo phosphorylated BAK1 and proteins representing the ligand-specific binding receptors EF-Tu receptor and Pep1 receptor 1, respectively. Thus, we propose that several LRR-RKs form tight complexes with BAK1 almost instantaneously after ligand binding and that the subsequent phosphorylation events are key initial steps in signal transduction.},

abstract = {Chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, is found in fungal cell walls but not in plants. Plant cells can perceive chitin fragments (chitooligosaccharides) leading to gene induction and defense responses. We identified a LysM receptor-like protein (LysM RLK1) required for chitin signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutation in this gene blocked the induction of almost all chitooligosaccharide-responsive genes and led to more susceptibility to fungal pathogens but had no effect on infection by a bacterial pathogen. Additionally, exogenously applied chitooligosaccharides enhanced resistance against both fungal and bacterial pathogens in the wild-type plants but not in the mutant. Together, our data indicate that LysM RLK1 is essential for chitin signaling in plants (likely as part of the receptor complex) and is involved in chitin-mediated plant innate immunity. The LysM RLK1-mediated chitin signaling pathway is unique, but it may share a conserved downstream pathway with the FLS2/flagellin- and EFR/EF-Tu-mediated signaling pathways. Additionally, our work suggests a possible evolutionary relationship between the chitin and Nod factor perception mechanisms due to the similarities between their potential receptors and between the signal molecules perceived by them.},

More than 250 inbred strains have been deposited thus far into the National Bio Resource Project for the Rat and are maintained as specific pathogen-free rats or cryopreserved embryos. We are now comprehensively characterizing deposited strains as part of the Rat Phenome Project to reevaluate their value as models of human diseases. Phenotypic data are being collected for 7 categories and 109 parameters: functional observational battery (neurobehavior), behavior studies, blood pressure, biochemical blood tests, hematology, urology, and anatomy. Furthermore, genotypes are being determined for 370 simple sequence-length polymorphism markers distributed through the whole rat genome. Here, we report these large-scale, high-throughput screening data that have already been collected for 54 rat strains. This comprehensive, original phenotypic data can be systematically viewed by "strain ranking" for each parameter. This allows investigators to explore the relationship between several rat strains, to identify new rat models, and to select the most suitable strains for specific experiments. The discovery of several potential models for human diseases, such as hypertension, hypotension, renal diseases, hyperlipemia, hematological disorders, and neurological disorders, illustrates the potential of many existing rat strains.

Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) detect microbes by recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Although the overall importance of PAMP-triggered immunity for plant defense is established, it has not been used to confer disease resistance in crops. We report that activity of a PRR is retained after its transfer between two plant families. Expression of EFR (ref. 4), a PRR from the cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, confers responsiveness to bacterial elongation factor Tu in the solanaceous plants Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), making them more resistant to a range of phytopathogenic bacteria from different genera. Our results in controlled laboratory conditions suggest that heterologous expression of PAMP recognition systems could be used to engineer broad-spectrum disease resistance to important bacterial pathogens, potentially enabling more durable and sustainable resistance in the field.},

@article{Koski2001,
abstract = {It is well known that basing phylogenetic reconstructions on uncorrected genetic distances can lead to errors in their reconstruction. Nevertheless, it is often common practice to report simply the most similar BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) hit in genomic reports that discuss many genes (Ruepp et al. 2000; Freiberg et al. 1997). This is because BLAST hits can provide a rapid, efficient, and concise analysis of many genes at once. These hits are often interpreted to imply that the gene is most closely related to the gene or protein in the databases that returned the closest BLAST hit. Though these two may coincide, for many genes, particularly genes with few homologs, they may not be the same. There are a number of circumstances that can account for such limitations in accuracy (Eisen 2000). We stress here that genes appearing to be the most similar based on BLAST hits are often not each others closest relative phylogenetically. The extent to which this occurs depends on the availability of close relatives present in the databases. As an example we have chosen the analysis of the genomes of a crenarcheaota species Aeropyrum pernix, an organism with few close relatives fully sequenced, and Escherichia coli, an organism whose closest relative, Salmonella typhimurium, is completely sequenced.},

From publicly available data, it was possible to make 49 pairwise comparisons of whole bacterial genomes that were related at the genus or subgenus level. DNA sequence identity scores for eight of the genes correlated strongly with overall sequence identity scores for the genome pairs. Even single-gene alignments could predict overall genome relatedness with a high degree of precision and accuracy. Predictions could be refined further by including two or three genes in the analysis. The proposal that sequence analysis of a small set of protein-encoding genes could reliably assign novel strains or isolates to bacterial species is strongly supported.},

We obtained peptide evidence for 26,463 rat liver proteins. We validated 1,195 gene predictions, 83 splice events, 126 proteins with nonsynonymous variants, and 20 isoforms with nonsynonymous RNA editing. Quantitative RNA sequencing and proteomics data correlate highly between strains but poorly among each other, indicating extensive nongenetic regulation. Our multilevel analysis identified a genomic variant in the promoter of the most differentially expressed gene Cyp17a1, a previously reported top hit in genome-wide association studies for human hypertension, as a potential contributor to the hypertension phenotype in SHR rats. These results demonstrate the power of and need for integrative analysis for understanding genetic control of molecular dynamics and phenotypic diversity in a system-wide manner.},

Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

@article{Cingolani2012,
abstract = {This paper describes a new program SnpSift for filtering differential DNA sequence variants between two or more experimental genomes after genotoxic chemical exposure. Here, we illustrate how SnpSift can be used to identify candidate phenotype-relevant variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions (InDels) in mutant strains isolated from genome-wide chemical mutagenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. First, the genomes of two independently isolated mutant fly strains that are allelic for a novel recessive male-sterile locus generated by genotoxic chemical exposure were sequenced using the Illumina next-generation DNA sequencer to obtain 20- to 29-fold coverage of the euchromatic sequences. The sequencing reads were processed and variants were called using standard bioinformatic tools. Next, SnpEff was used to annotate all sequence variants and their potential mutational effects on associated genes. Then, SnpSift was used to filter and select differential variants that potentially disrupt a common gene in the two allelic mutant strains. The potential causative DNA lesions were partially validated by capillary sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA in the genetic interval as defined by meiotic mapping and deletions that remove defined regions of the chromosome. Of the five candidate genes located in the genetic interval, the Pka-like gene CG12069 was found to carry a separate pre-mature stop codon mutation in each of the two allelic mutants whereas the other four candidate genes within the interval have wild-type sequences. The Pka-like gene is therefore a strong candidate gene for the male-sterile locus. These results demonstrate that combining SnpEff and SnpSift can expedite the identification of candidate phenotype-causative mutations in chemically mutagenized Drosophila strains. This technique can also be used to characterize the variety of mutations generated by genotoxic chemicals.},

abstract = {Plant resistance to disease is controlled by the combination of defense response pathways that are activated depending on the nature of the pathogen. We identified the Arabidopsis thaliana BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1) gene that is transcriptionally regulated by Botrytis cinerea infection. Inactivation of BIK1 causes severe susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens but enhances resistance to a virulent strain of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. The response to an avirulent bacterial strain is unchanged, limiting the role of BIK1 to basal defense rather than race-specific resistance. The jasmonate- and ethylene-regulated defense response, generally associated with resistance to necrotrophic fungi, is attenuated in the bik1 mutant based on the expression of the plant defensin PDF1.2 gene. bik1 mutants show altered root growth, producing more and longer root hairs, demonstrating that BIK1 is also required for normal plant growth and development. Whereas the pathogen responses of bik1 are mostly dependent on salicylic acid (SA) levels, the nondefense responses are independent of SA. BIK1 is membrane-localized, suggesting possible involvement in early stages of the recognition or transduction of pathogen response. Our data suggest that BIK1 modulates the signaling of cellular factors required for defense responses to pathogen infection and normal root hair growth, linking defense response regulation with that of growth and development.},

Several plant MAPKs are activated by a variety of stress stimuli, including pathogen infection, wounding, temperature, drought, salinity, osmolarity, UV irradiation, ozone and reactive oxygen species. Recent gain-of-function studies show that two tobacco MAPKs induce the expression of defense genes and cause cell death. By contrast, loss-of-function studies of other MAPK pathways revealed negative regulation of disease resistance. This ‘push-and-pull’ regulation by different MAPK pathways might provide a more precise control of plant defense responses.},

To examine the importance of aspartic acid (D) at position 43 from the N-terminus of a flagellin in its elicitor activity, D43 was replaced with valine (V) and alanine (A) in P. syringae pv. tabaci flagellin and flg22Pta. The abilities of flagellins from P. syringae pv. tabaci D43V and D43A to induce cell death and growth inhibition were reduced, whereas the abilities of flg22PtaD43V and flg22PtaD43A were abolished. These results indicate that D43 is important for elicitor activity in P. syringae pv. tabaci. When tobacco plants were inoculated with each bacterium by the spray method, both P. syringae pv. tabaci D43V and D43A mutants had remarkably reduced ability to cause disease symptoms. Both mutants had reduced or no swimming and swarming motilities and adhesion ability. In P. syringae pv. tabaci D43V, little flagellin protein was detected and few flagella were observed by electron microscopy. These results indicate that mutant flagella are unstable and that flagellar motility is impaired. Thus, the amino acid residue required for MAMP activity is important for the intrinsic flagellar function.},

Among them are gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, copy number variation, and protein-protein/gene-gene interactions. Each of these distinct data types provides a different, partly independent and complementary, view of the whole genome. However, understanding functions of genes, proteins, and other aspects of the genome requires more information than provided by each of the datasets. Integrating data from different sources is, therefore, an important part of current research in genomics and proteomics. Data integration also plays important roles in combining clinical, environmental, and demographic data with high-throughput genomic data. Nevertheless, the concept of data integration is not well defined in the literature and it may mean different things to different researchers. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for integrating genetic, genomic, and proteomic data. The framework captures fundamental aspects of data integration and is developed taking the key steps in genetic, genomic, and proteomic data fusion. Secondly, we provide a review of some of the most commonly used current methods and approaches for combining genomic data with focus on the statistical aspects.},

abstract = {RD21-like proteases are ubiquitous, plant-specific papain-like proteases typified by carrying a C-terminal granulin domain. RD21-like proteases are involved in immunity and associated with senescence and various types of biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we interrogated Arabidopsis RD21 regulation and trafficking by site-directed mutagenesis, agroinfiltration, western blotting, protease activity profiling and protein degradation. Using an introduced N-glycan sensor, deglycosylation experiments and glyco-engineered N. benthamiana plants, we show that RD21 passes through the Golgi where it becomes fucosylated. Our studies demonstrate that RD21 is regulated at three post-translational levels. Prodomain removal is not blocked in the catalytic Cys mutant, indicating that RD21 is activated by a proteolytic cascade. However, RD21 activation in Arabidopsis does not require vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) or aleurain-like protease AALP. In contrast, granulin domain removal requires the catalytic Cys and His residues and is therefore autocatalytic. Furthermore, SDS can (re-)activate latent RD21 in Arabidopsis leaf extracts, indicating the existence of a third layer of post-translational regulation, possibly mediated by endogenous inhibitors. RD21 causes a dominant protease activity in Arabidopsis leaf extracts, responsible for SDS-induced proteome degradation.},

We propose that the mode of plant immunity is mainly determined by how the shared signaling network is used rather than by a signaling machinery specific to each mode, that balancing the robustness of immunity and the negative effect of immunity on plant fitness is a key driver in evolution of the immune network, that comparisons of plant mutant to wild-type phenotypes may not be very effective in elucidating the underlying signaling mechanisms, and that mechanistic understanding of the network can improve our ability to predict the performance of immunity.},

Here, we describe the current PANTHER process as a whole, as well as the website tools for analysis of user-uploaded data. The main goals of PANTHER remain essentially unchanged: the accurate inference (and practical application) of gene and protein function over large sequence databases, using phylogenetic trees to extrapolate from the relatively sparse experimental information from a few model organisms. Yet the focus of PANTHER has continually shifted toward more accurate and detailed representations of evolutionary events in gene family histories. The trees are now designed to represent gene family evolution, including inference of evolutionary events, such as speciation and gene duplication. Subfamilies are still curated and used to define HMMs, but gene ontology functional annotations can now be made at any node in the tree, and are designed to represent gain and loss of function by ancestral genes during evolution. Finally, PANTHER now includes stable database identifiers for inferred ancestral genes, which are used to associate inferred gene attributes with particular genes in the common ancestral genomes of extant species.},

abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are phytosteroid hormones controlling various physiological processes critical for normal growth and development. BRs are perceived by a protein complex containing two transmembrane receptor kinases, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) [1-3]. BRI1 null mutants exhibit a dwarfed stature with epinastic leaves, delayed senescence, reduced male fertility, and altered light responses. BAK1 null mutants, however, only show a subtle phenotype, suggesting that functionally redundant proteins might be present in the Arabidopsis genome. Here we report that BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1) functions redundantly with BAK1 in regulating BR signaling. Surprisingly, rather than the expected bri1-like phenotype, bak1 bkk1 double mutants exhibit a seedling-lethality phenotype due to constitutive defense-gene expression, callose deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and spontaneous cell death even under sterile growing conditions. Our detailed analyses demonstrate that BAK1 and BKK1 have dual physiological roles: positively regulating a BR-dependent plant growth pathway, and negatively regulating a BR-independent cell-death pathway. Both BR signaling and developmentally controlled cell death are critical to optimal plant growth and development, but the mechanisms regulating early events in these pathways are poorly understood. This study provides novel insights into the initiation and crosstalk of the two signaling cascades.},

abstract = {Type III pili deliver effector proteins (virulence factors) from bacterial pathogens to host cells. Plants express disease resistance (R) proteins that respond specifically to a particular type III effector by activating immune responses. We demonstrated previously that two unrelated type III effectors from Pseudomonas syringae target and modify the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein. Here, we show that AvrRpt2, a third, unrelated type III effector, also targets RIN4 and induces its posttranscriptional disappearance. This effect is independent of the presence of RPS2, the Arabidopsis R protein that senses AvrRpt2. RIN4 overexpression inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function. Conversely, disruption of RIN4 results in RPS2-dependent lethality. RPS2 and RIN4 physically associate in the plant. We suggest that RIN4 is the target of the AvrRpt2 virulence function, and that perturbation of RIN4 activates RPS2. Thus, RIN4 is a point of convergence for the activity of at least three unrelated P. syringae type III effectors.},

abstract = {Over the past 5 years, large-scale sequencing has been revolutionized by the development of several so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These have drastically increased the number of bases obtained per sequencing run while at the same time decreasing the costs per base. Compared to Sanger sequencing, NGS technologies yield shorter read lengths; however, despite this drawback, they have greatly facilitated genome sequencing, first for prokaryotic genomes and within the last year also for eukaryotic ones. This advance was possible due to a concomitant development of software that allows the de novo assembly of draft genomes from large numbers of short reads. In addition, NGS can be used for metagenomics studies as well as for the detection of sequence variations within individual genomes, e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (indels), or structural variants. Furthermore, NGS technologies have quickly been adopted for other high-throughput studies that were previously performed mostly by hybridization-based methods like microarrays. This includes the use of NGS for transcriptomics (RNA-seq) or the genome-wide analysis of DNA/protein interactions (ChIP-seq). This review provides an overview of NGS technologies that are currently available and the bioinformatics analyses that are necessary to obtain information from the flood of sequencing data as well as applications of NGS to address biological questions in eukaryotic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Cell-surface-localized plant immune receptors, such as FLS2, detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) through poorly understood signal-transduction pathways. The pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPphB, a cysteine protease, cleaves the Arabidopsis receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBS1 to trigger cytoplasmic immune receptor RPS5-specified effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Analyzing the function of AvrPphB in plants lacking RPS5, we find that AvrPphB can inhibit PTI by cleaving additional PBS1-like (PBL) kinases, including BIK1, PBL1, and PBL2. In unstimulated plants, BIK1 and PBL1 interact with FLS2 and are rapidly phosphorylated upon FLS2 activation by its ligand flg22. Genetic and molecular analyses indicate that BIK1, and possibly PBL1, PBL2, and PBS1, integrate immune signaling from multiple immune receptors. Whereas AvrPphB-mediated degradation of one of these kinases, PBS1, is monitored by RPS5 to initiate ETI, this pathogenic effector targets other PBL kinases for PTI inhibition.},

abstract = {In Arabidopsis, RPM1 confers resistance against Pseudomonas syringae expressing either of two sequence unrelated type III effectors, AvrRpm1 or AvrB. An RPM1-interacting protein (RIN4) coimmunoprecipitates from plant cell extracts with AvrB, AvrRpm1, or RPM1. Reduction of RIN4 protein levels inhibits both the hypersensitive response and the restriction of pathogen growth controlled by RPM1. RIN4 reduction causes diminution of RPM1. RIN4 reduction results in heightened resistance to virulent Peronospora parasitica and P. syringae, and ectopic defense gene expression. Thus, RIN4 positively regulates RPM1-mediated resistance yet is, formally, a negative regulator of basal defense responses. AvrRpm1 and AvrB induce RIN4 phosphorylation. This may enhance RIN4 activity as a negative regulator of plant defense, facilitating pathogen growth. RPM1 may "guard" against pathogens that use AvrRpm1 and AvrB to manipulate RIN4 activity.},

abstract = {There is emerging evidence that the proteolytic machinery of plants plays important roles in defense against pathogens. The oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, the agent of the devastating late blight disease of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum), has evolved an arsenal of protease inhibitors to overcome the action of host proteases. Previously, we described a family of 14 Kazal-like extracellular serine protease inhibitors from P. infestans. Among these, EPI1 and EPI10 bind and inhibit the pathogenesis-related (PR) P69B subtilisin-like serine protease of tomato. Here, we describe EPIC1 to EPIC4, a new family of P. infestans secreted proteins with similarity to cystatin-like protease inhibitor domains. Among these, the epiC1 and epiC2 genes lacked orthologs in Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum, were relatively fast-evolving within P. infestans, and were up-regulated during infection of tomato, suggesting a role during P. infestans-host interactions. Biochemical functional analyses revealed that EPIC2B interacts with and inhibits a novel papain-like extracellular cysteine protease, termed Phytophthora Inhibited Protease 1 (PIP1). Characterization of PIP1 revealed that it is a PR protein closely related to Rcr3, a tomato apoplastic cysteine protease that functions in fungal resistance. Altogether, this and earlier studies suggest that interplay between host proteases of diverse catalytic families and pathogen inhibitors is a general defense-counterdefense process in plant-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq can be used to measure allele-specific expression (ASE) by assigning sequence reads to individual alleles; however, relative ASE is systematically biased when sequence reads are aligned to a single reference genome. Aligning sequence reads to both parental genomes can eliminate this bias, but this approach is not always practical, especially for non-model organisms. To improve accuracy of ASE measured using a single reference genome, we identified properties of differentiating sites responsible for biased measures of relative ASE.

RESULTS: We found that clusters of differentiating sites prevented sequence reads from an alternate allele from aligning to the reference genome, causing a bias in relative ASE favoring the reference allele. This bias increased with greater sequence divergence between alleles. Increasing the number of mismatches allowed when aligning sequence reads to the reference genome and restricting analysis to genomic regions with fewer differentiating sites than the number of mismatches allowed almost completely eliminated this systematic bias. Accuracy of allelic abundance was increased further by excluding differentiating sites within sequence reads that could not be aligned uniquely within the genome (imperfect mappability) and reads that overlapped one or more insertions or deletions (indels) between alleles.

CONCLUSIONS: After aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, excluding differentiating sites with at least as many neighboring differentiating sites as the number of mismatches allowed, imperfect mappability, and/or an indel(s) nearby resulted in measures of allelic abundance comparable to those derived from aligning sequence reads to both parental genomes.},

abstract = {Next-generation-sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of genome assembly because of its much higher data throughput and much lower cost compared with traditional Sanger sequencing. However, NGS poses new computational challenges to de novo genome assembly. Among the challenges, GC bias in NGS data is known to aggravate genome assembly. However, it is not clear to what extent GC bias affects genome assembly in general. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis on the effects of GC bias on genome assembly. Our analyses reveal that GC bias only lowers assembly completeness when the degree of GC bias is above a threshold. At a strong GC bias, the assembly fragmentation due to GC bias can be explained by the low coverage of reads in the GC-poor or GC-rich regions of a genome. This effect is observed for all the assemblers under study. Increasing the total amount of NGS data thus rescues the assembly fragmentation because of GC bias. However, the amount of data needed for a full rescue depends on the distribution of GC contents. Both low and high coverage depths due to GC bias lower the accuracy of assembly. These pieces of information provide guidance toward a better de novo genome assembly in the presence of GC bias.},

abstract = {Plants and animals mediate early steps of the innate immune response through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs commonly associate with or contain members of a monophyletic group of kinases called the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family that include Drosophila Pelle, human IRAKs, rice XA21 and Arabidopsis FLS2. In mammals, PRRs can also associate with members of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, distant relatives to the IRAK family. Some IRAK and RIP family kinases fall into a small functional class of kinases termed non-RD, many of which do not autophosphorylate the activation loop. We surveyed the yeast, fly, worm, human, Arabidopsis, and rice kinomes (3,723 kinases) and found that despite the small number of non-RD kinases in these genomes (9\%-29\%), 12 of 15 kinases known or predicted to function in PRR signaling fall into the non-RD class. These data indicate that kinases associated with PRRs can largely be predicted by the lack of a single conserved residue and reveal new potential plant PRR subfamilies.},

This disease has remained particularly problematic despite intensive breeding efforts to integrate resistance into cultivated potato, largely because of the pathogen's ability to quickly evolve to overcome major resistance genes. The RB gene, identified in the wild potato species S. bulbocastanum, encodes a protein that confers broad-spectrum resistance to most P. infestans isolates through its recognition of highly conserved members of the corresponding pathogen effector family IPI-O. IpiO is a multigene family of effectors and while the majority of IPI-O proteins are recognized by RB to elicit host resistance, some variants exist that are able to elude detection (e.g. IPI-O4).},

abstract = {Yeast and animals use mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades to mediate stress and extracellular signals. We have tested whether MAP kinases are involved in mediating environmental stress responses in plants. Using specific peptide antibodies that were raised against different alfalfa MAP kinases, we found exclusive activation of p44MMK4 kinase in drought- and cold-treated plants. p44MMK4 kinase was transiently activated by these treatments and was correlated with a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the p44MMK4 protein. Although transcript levels of the MMK4 gene accumulated after drought and cold treatment, no changes in p44MMK4 steady state protein levels were observed, indicating a posttranslational activation mechanism. Extreme temperatures, drought, and salt stress are considered to be different forms of osmotic stress. However, high salt concentrations or heat shock did not induce activation of p44MMK4, indicating the existence of distinct mechanisms to mediate different stresses in alfalfa. Stress adaptation in plants is mediated by abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent processes. Although ABA rapidly induced the transcription of an ABA-inducible marker gene, MMK4 transcript levels did not increase and p44MMK4 kinase was not activated. These data indicate that the MMK4 kinase pathway mediates drought and cold signaling independently of ABA.},

abstract = {Despite the potentially profound impact of genetically modified crops on agriculture and the environment, we know little about their long-term effects. Transgenic crops that produce toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control insects are grown widely, but rapid evolution of resistance by pests could nullify their benefits. Here, we present theoretical analyses showing that long-term suppression of pest populations is governed by interactions among reproductive rate, dispersal propensity, and regional abundance of a Bt crop. Supporting this theory, a 10-year study in 15 regions across Arizona shows that Bt cotton suppressed a major pest, pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), independent of demographic effects of weather and variation among regions. Pink bollworm population density declined only in regions where Bt cotton was abundant. Such long-term suppression has not been observed with insecticide sprays, showing that transgenic crops open new avenues for pest control. The debate about putative benefits of Bt crops has focused primarily on short-term decreases in insecticide use. The present findings suggest that long-term regional pest suppression after deployment of Bt crops may also contribute to reducing the need for insecticide sprays.},

abstract = {Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) for the detection of various potential pathogens in innate immune systems of both plants and animals. We recently showed that chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP), plasma membrane glycoprotein with LysM motifs, functions as a cell surface receptor for chitin elicitor in rice. The predicted structure of CEBiP does not contain any intracellular domains, suggesting that an additional component(s) is required for signaling through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Here, we identified a receptor-like kinase, designated CERK1, which is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis. The KO mutants for CERK1 completely lost the ability to respond to the chitin elicitor, including MAPK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and gene expression. Disease resistance of the KO mutant against an incompatible fungus, Alternaria brassicicola, was partly impaired. Complementation with the WT CERK1 gene showed cerk1 mutations were responsible for the mutant phenotypes. CERK1 is a plasma membrane protein containing three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain with autophosphorylation/myelin basic protein kinase activity, suggesting that CERK1 plays a critical role in fungal MAMP perception in plants.},

abstract = {Bacterial flagellin is known to stimulate host immune responses in mammals and plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the receptor kinase FLS2 mediates flagellin perception through physical interaction with a highly conserved epitope in the N-terminus of flagellin, represented by the peptide flg22 derived from Pseudomonas syringae. The peptide flg22 is highly active as an elicitor in many plant species. In contrast, a shortened version of the same epitope derived from Escherichia coli, flg15(E coli), is highly active as an elicitor in tomato but not in A. thaliana or Nicotiana benthamiana. Here, we make use of these species-specific differences in flagellin perception abilities to identify LeFLS2 as the flagellin receptor in tomato. LeFLS2 is most closely related to AtFLS2, indicating that it may represent the flagellin receptor of tomato. Expression of the LeFLS2 gene in Arabidopsis did not result in accumulation of its corresponding gene product, as indicated by experiments with LeFLS2-GFP fusions. In contrast, expression of LeFLS2-GFP fusions in N. benthamiana, a species that, like tomato, belongs to the Solanaceae, was obviously functional. N. benthamiana plants transiently expressing a LeFLS2-GFP fusion acquired responsiveness to flg15(E coli) to which they are normally unresponsive. Thus, LeFLS2 encodes a functional, specific flagellin receptor, the first to be identified in a plant family other than the Brassicaceae.},

abstract = {Plants and animals recognize microbial invaders by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as flagellin. However, the importance of flagellin perception for disease resistance has, until now, not been demonstrated. Here we show that treatment of plants with flg22, a peptide representing the elicitor-active epitope of flagellin, induces the expression of numerous defence-related genes and triggers resistance to pathogenic bacteria in wild-type plants, but not in plants carrying mutations in the flagellin receptor gene FLS2. This induced resistance seems to be independent of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling. Wild-type and fls2 mutants both display enhanced resistance when treated with crude bacterial extracts, even devoid of elicitor-active flagellin, indicating the existence of functional perception systems for PAMPs other than flagellin. Although fls2 mutant plants are as susceptible as the wild type when bacteria are infiltrated into leaves, they are more susceptible to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 when it is sprayed on the leaf surface. Thus, flagellin perception restricts bacterial invasion, probably at an early step, and contributes to the plant's disease resistance.},

abstract = {To date, two genes have been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis. The first, CDKN2A, is a tumour suppressor gene with germline mutations detected in 20\% of melanoma-prone families. The second, CDK4, is an oncogene with co-segregating germline mutations detected in only three kindreds worldwide. We examined 16 American melanoma-prone families for mutations in all coding exons of CDK4 and screened additional members of two previously reported families with the Arg24Cys germline CDK4 mutation to evaluate the penetrance of the mutation. No new CDK4 mutations were identified. In the two Arg24Cys families, the penetrance was estimated to be 63\%. Overall, 12 out of 12 invasive melanoma patients, none out of one in situ melanoma patient, five out of 13 dysplastic naevi patients, two out of 15 unaffected family members, and none out of 10 spouses carried the Arg24Cys mutation. Dysplastic naevi did not strongly co-segregate with the Arg24Cys mutation. Thus the phenotype observed in melanoma-prone CDK4 families appears to be more complex than just the CDK4 mutation. Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to contribute to the occurrence of melanoma and dysplastic naevi in these families. In summary, although CDK4 is a melanoma susceptibility gene, it plays a minor role in hereditary melanoma.},

Historically, advances in plant genetics have provided new knowledge and technologies needed to address these challenges. Plant genetics remains a key component of global food security, peace, and prosperity for the foreseeable future. Millions of lives depend upon the extent to which crop genetic improvement can keep pace with the growing global population, changing climate, and shrinking environmental resources. While there is still much to be learned about the biology of plant-environment interactions, the fundamental technologies of plant genetic improvement, including crop genetic engineering, are in place, and are expected to play crucial roles in meeting the chronic demands of global food security. However, genetically improved seed is only part of the solution. Such seed must be integrated into ecologically based farming systems and evaluated in light of their environmental, economic, and social impacts-the three pillars of sustainable agriculture. In this review, I describe some lessons learned, over the last decade, of how genetically engineered crops have been integrated into agricultural practices around the world and discuss their current and future contribution to sustainable agricultural systems.},

As the number of ortholog databases has grown, it has become difficult to compare among these resources due to a lack of standardized source data and incompatible representations of ortholog relationships. To facilitate data exchange and comparisons among ortholog databases, we have developed and are making available two XML schemas: SeqXML for the input sequences and OrthoXML for the output ortholog clusters.},

abstract = {A key feature of innate immunity is the ability to recognize and respond to potential pathogens in a highly sensitive and specific manner. In plants, the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) elicits a defense programme known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Although only a handful of PAMP-PRR pairs have been defined, all known PRRs are modular transmembrane proteins containing ligand-binding ectodomains. It is becoming clear that PRRs do not act alone but rather function as part of multi-protein complexes at the plasma membrane. Recent studies describing the molecular interactions and protein modifications that occur between PRRs and their regulatory proteins have provided important mechanistic insight into how plants avoid infection and achieve immunity.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector protein avirulence protein B (AvrB) is delivered into plant cells, where it targets the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein (resistance to Pseudomonas maculicula protein 1 [RPM1]-interacting protein). RIN4 is a regulator of basal host defense responses. Targeting of RIN4 by AvrB is recognized by the host RPM1 nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat disease resistance protein, leading to accelerated defense responses, cessation of pathogen growth, and hypersensitive host cell death at the infection site. We determined the structure of AvrB complexed with an AvrB-binding fragment of RIN4 at 2.3 A resolution. We also determined the structure of AvrB in complex with adenosine diphosphate bound in a binding pocket adjacent to the RIN4 binding domain. AvrB residues important for RIN4 interaction are required for full RPM1 activation. AvrB residues that contact adenosine diphosphate are also required for initiation of RPM1 function. Nucleotide-binding residues of AvrB are also required for its phosphorylation by an unknown Arabidopsis protein(s). We conclude that AvrB is activated inside the host cell by nucleotide binding and subsequent phosphorylation and, independently, interacts with RIN4. Our data suggest that activated AvrB, bound to RIN4, is indirectly recognized by RPM1 to initiate plant immune system function.},

How to efficiently map millions of short reads to the reference genome and how to make accurate SNP calls are two major challenges in taking full advantage of NGS. In this article, we reviewed the current software tools for mapping and SNP calling, and evaluated their performance on samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We found that BWA and Bowtie are better than the other alignment tools in comprehensive performance for Illumina platform, while NovoalignCS showed the best overall performance for SOLiD. Furthermore, we showed that next-generation sequencing platform has significantly lower coverage and poorer SNP-calling performance in the CpG islands, promoter and 5'-UTR regions of the genome. NGS experiments targeting for these regions should have higher sequencing depth than the normal genomic region.},

abstract = {Cellodextrins (CD), water-soluble derivatives of cellulose composed of beta-1,4 glucoside residues, have been shown to induce a variety of defence responses in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cells. The larger oligomers of CD rapidly induced transient generation of H2O2 and elevation in free cytosolic calcium, followed by a differential expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins as well as stimulation of chitinase and beta-1,3 glucanase activities. Most of these defence reactions were also induced by linear beta-1,3 glucans (betaGlu) and alpha-1,4 oligogalacturonides (OGA) of different degree of polymerization (DP), but the intensity of some reactions induced by CD was different when compared with betaGlu and OGA effects. Moreover, desensitization assays using H2O2 production showed that cells treated with CD remained fully responsive to a second application of OGA, suggesting a different mode of perception of these oligosaccharides by grape cells. None of CD, betaGlu, or OGA induced HSR gene expression nor did they induce cell death. In accordance with elicitor activity in grapevine cells, CD-incubated leaves challenged with Botrytis cinerea also resulted in a significant reduction of the disease. Data suggest that CD could operate via other distinct reaction pathways than betaGlu and OGA. They also highlight the requirement of a specific DP for each oligosaccharide to induce the defence response.},

abstract = {Pathogenic microbes use effectors to enhance susceptibility in host plants. However, plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system to detect these effectors using cognate disease resistance proteins, a recognition that is highly specific, often elicits rapid and localized cell death, known as a hypersensitive response, and thus potentially limits pathogen growth. Despite numerous genetic and biochemical studies on the interactions between pathogen effector proteins and plant resistance proteins, the structural bases for such interactions remain elusive. The direct interaction between the tomato protein kinase Pto and the Pseudomonas syringae effector protein AvrPto is known to trigger disease resistance and programmed cell death through the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class of disease resistance protein Prf. Here we present the crystal structure of an AvrPto-Pto complex. Contrary to the widely held hypothesis that AvrPto activates Pto kinase activity, our structural and biochemical analyses demonstrated that AvrPto is an inhibitor of Pto kinase in vitro. The AvrPto-Pto interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation-stabilized P+1 loop and a second loop in Pto, both of which negatively regulate the Prf-mediated defences in the absence of AvrPto in tomato plants. Together, our results show that AvrPto derepresses host defences by interacting with the two defence-inhibition loops of Pto.},

Out of sixteen families of LRR-RLKs in Arabidopsis, the LRR-RLKII family consists of fourteen individual members, including five Arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (AtSERKs). BAK1/AtSERK3 was first identified as a dual co-receptor of BRI1 and FLS2, mediating BR signaling and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI), respectively. Since its identification, many researchers have attempted to elucidate the phosphorylation mechanisms between receptor complexes and identify additional components that interact with receptor complexes to transduce the signaling downstream. Relatively detailed early events in complex formation, phosphorylation sites on the BRI1/BAK1 complex and BAK1-interacting proteins, such as BIK1 and PUB13, have been identified. Small receptor complexes consisting of BAK1 and BIR1 or BAK1 and AtSERK4 regulate cell death during steady state conditions. Moreover, the redundant and distinct functions of AtSERK proteins and other members of the LRR-RLKII family have been revealed. This review focuses on the integration of the information from the most recent studies concerning BAK1 and its homologs.},

abstract = {Pathogenic bacterial effectors suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered host immunity, thereby promoting parasitism. In the presence of cognate resistance genes, it is proposed that plants detect the virulence activity of bacterial effectors and trigger a defense response, referred to here as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, the link between effector virulence and ETI at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrB suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) through RAR1, a co-chaperone of HSP90 required for ETI. AvrB expressed in plants lacking the cognate resistance gene RPM1 suppresses cell wall defense induced by the flagellar peptide flg22, a well known PAMP, and promotes the growth of nonpathogenic bacteria in a RAR1-dependent manner. rar1 mutants display enhanced cell wall defense in response to flg22, indicating that RAR1 negatively regulates PTI. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RAR1 and AvrB interact in the plant. The results demonstrate that RAR1 molecularly links PTI, effector virulence, and ETI. The study supports that both pathogen virulence and plant disease resistance have evolved around PTI.},

abstract = {New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.},

abstract = {The perception of downy mildew avirulence (Arabidopsis thaliana Recognized [ATR]) gene products by matching Arabidopsis thaliana resistance (Recognition of Peronospora parasitica [RPP]) gene products triggers localized cell death (a hypersensitive response) in the host plant, and this inhibits pathogen development. The oomycete pathogen, therefore, is under selection pressure to alter the form of these gene products to prevent detection. That the pathogen maintains these genes indicates that they play a positive role in pathogen survival. Despite significant progress in cloning plant RPP genes and characterizing essential plant components of resistance signaling pathways, little progress has been made in identifying the oomycete molecules that trigger them. Concluding a map-based cloning effort, we have identified an avirulence gene, ATR1NdWsB, that is detected by RPP1 from the Arabidopsis accession Niederzenz in the cytoplasm of host plant cells. We report the cloning of six highly divergent alleles of ATR1NdWsB from eight downy mildew isolates and demonstrate that the ATR1NdWsB alleles are differentially recognized by RPP1 genes from two Arabidopsis accessions (Niederzenz and Wassilewskija). RPP1-Nd recognizes a single allele of ATR1NdWsB; RPP1-WsB also detects this allele plus three additional alleles with divergent sequences. The Emco5 isolate expresses an allele of ATR1NdWsB that is recognized by RPP1-WsB, but the isolate evades detection in planta. Although the Cala2 isolate is recognized by RPP1-WsA, the ATR1NdWsB allele from Cala2 is not, demonstrating that RPP1-WsA detects a novel ATR gene product. Cloning of ATR1NdWsB has highlighted the presence of a highly conserved novel amino acid motif in avirulence proteins from three different oomycetes. The presence of the motif in additional secreted proteins from plant pathogenic oomycetes and its similarity to a host-targeting signal from malaria parasites suggest a conserved role in pathogenicity.},

abstract = {Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) contribute to a range of germline, as well as somatic mutations in mammals. However, autonomous retrotransposition of potentially active elements has not been demonstrated in the rat genome. We cloned an insertion that disrupted the normal splicing of the Cntrob gene that was subsequently identified as a nonautonomous, novel endogenous retrovirus of the RnERV-K8e family. The RnERV-K8e family is closely related to the recently reported MmERV-K10c elements, but differs from the autonomous mouse MusD or IAP families. In addition, we identified a novel, unexpectedly close relative of RnERV-K8e in the mouse, suggesting ERV-K cross-species transmission between mice and rats. We cloned a potentially autonomous RnERV-K8e element identified by in silico analysis and, using an in vitro retrotransposition assay, demonstrated that it is capable of retrotransposition. This particular element (named Rat-rho, pronounced "retro") encodes a retroviral envelope gene (env); however, env is not required for de novo retrotransposition events. Significant levels of RnERV-K8e-associated genetic polymorphisms were detected among inbred rat strains, suggesting ongoing retrotransposition in the rat genome. This study identifies an ERV-K-type family in rats that shows obvious signs of recent activity. Ongoing retrotranspositional activity may significantly add to genomic variability among inbred rat strains.},

abstract = {We previously identified three Avr9/Cf-9 Rapidly Elicited (ACRE) genes essential for Cf-9- and Cf-4-dependent hypersensitive response (HR) production in Nicotiana benthamiana. Two of them encode putative E3 ubiquitin ligase components. This led us to investigate other ACRE genes associated with the ubiquitination pathway. ACRE74 encodes a U-box E3 ligase homolog, highly related to parsley (Petroselinum crispum) CMPG1 and Arabidopsis thaliana PLANT U-BOX20 (PUB20) and PUB21 proteins, and was called Nt CMPG1. Transcript levels of Nt CMPG1 and the homologous tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Cmpg1 are induced in Cf9 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Cf9 tomato after Avr9 elicitation. Tobacco CMPG1 possesses in vitro E3 ligase activity. N. benthamiana plants silenced for Nt CMPG1 show reduced HR after Cf-9/Avr9 elicitation, while overexpression of Nt CMPG1 induces a stronger HR in Cf9 tobacco plants after Avr9 infiltration. In tomato, silencing of Cmpg1 decreased resistance to Cladosporium fulvum. Overexpression of epitope-tagged tobacco CMPG1 mutated in the U-box domain confers a dominant-negative phenotype. We also show that Nt CMPG1 is involved in the Pto/AvrPto and Inf1 responses. In summary, we show that the E3 ligase Nt CMPG1 is essential for plant defense and disease resistance.},

abstract = {We have identified the Arabidopsis ortholog of barley RAR1 as a component of resistance specified by multiple nucleotide binding/Leu-rich repeat resistance (R) genes recognizing different bacterial and oomycete pathogen isolates. Characterization of partially and fully defective rar1 mutations revealed that wild-type RAR1 acts as a rate-limiting regulator of early R gene-triggered defenses, determining the extent of pathogen containment, hypersensitive plant cell death, and an oxidative burst at primary infection sites. We conclude that RAR1 defense signaling function is conserved between plant species that are separated evolutionarily by 150 million years. RAR1 encodes a protein with two zinc binding (CHORD) domains that are highly conserved across eukaryotic phyla, and the single nematode CHORD-containing homolog, Chp, was found previously to be essential for embryo viability. An absence of obvious developmental defects in null Arabidopsis rar1 mutants favors the notion that, in contrast, RAR1 does not play a fundamental role in plant development.},

Recent years have seen the development of a variety of so-called 'next-generation' sequencing platforms, with several others anticipated to become available shortly. The previously unimaginable scale and economy of these methods, coupled with their enthusiastic uptake by the scientific community and the potential for further improvements in accuracy and read length, suggest that these technologies are destined to make a huge and ongoing impact upon genomic and post-genomic biology. However, like the analysis of microarray data and the assembly and annotation of complete genome sequences from conventional sequencing data, the management and analysis of next-generation sequencing data requires (and indeed has already driven) the development of informatics tools able to assemble, map, and interpret huge quantities of relatively or extremely short nucleotide sequence data. Here we provide a broad overview of bioinformatics approaches that have been introduced for several genomics and functional genomics applications of next-generation sequencing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS), a complex disorder involving hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The Lyon Hypertensive (LH), Lyon Normotensive (LN) and Lyon Low-pressure (LL) rats are inbred strains simultaneously derived from a common outbred Sprague Dawley colony by selection for high, normal, and low blood pressure, respectively. Further studies found that LH is a MetS susceptible strain, while LN is resistant and LL has an intermediate phenotype. Whole genome sequencing determined that, while the strains are phenotypically divergent, they are nearly 98\% similar at the nucleotide level. Using the sequence of the three strains, we applied an approach that harnesses the distribution of Observed Strain Differences (OSD), or nucleotide diversity, to distinguish genomic regions of identity-by-descent (IBD) from those with divergent ancestry between the three strains. This information was then used to fine-map QTL identified in a cross between LH and LN rats in order to identify candidate genes causing the phenotypes.

RESULTS: We identified haplotypes that, in total, contain at least 95\% of the identifiable polymorphisms between the Lyon strains that are likely of differing ancestral origin. By intersecting the identified haplotype blocks with Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) previously identified in a cross between LH and LN strains, the candidate QTL regions have been narrowed by 78\%. Because the genome sequence has been determined, we were further able to identify putative functional variants in genes that are candidates for causing the QTL.

CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequence analysis between the LH, LN, and LL strains identified the haplotype structure of these three strains and identified candidate genes with sequence variants predicted to affect gene function. This approach, merged with additional integrative genetics approaches, will likely lead to novel mechanisms underlying complex disease and provide new drug targets and therapies.},

abstract = {Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are surface localized, transmembrane receptors comprising a large family of well-studied kinases. RLKs signal through their transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains with the aid of various interacting partners and downstream components. The N-terminal extracellular domain defines ligand specificity, and RLK families are sub-classed according to this domain. The most studied of these subfamilies include those with (1) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, (2) LysM domains (LYM), and (3) the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) domain. These proteins recognize distinct ligands of microbial origin or ligands derived from intracellular protein/carbohydrate signals. For example, the pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) AtFLS2 recognizes flg22 from flagellin, and the PRR AtEFR recognizes elf18 from elongation factor (EF-Tu). Upon binding of their cognate ligands, the aforementioned RLKs activate generic immune responses termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). RLKs can form complexes with other family members and engage a variety of intracellular signaling components and regulatory pathways upon stimulation. This review focuses on interesting new data about how these receptors form protein complexes to exert their function.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has pushed back the limitations of prior sequencing technologies to advance genomic knowledge infinitely by allowing cost-effective, rapid sequencing to become a reality. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling can be achieved using NGS with either Tag-Seq, in which short tags of cDNA represent a gene, or RNA-Seq, in which the entire transcriptome is sequenced. Furthermore, the level and diversity of miRNA within different tissues or cell types can be monitored by specifically sequencing small RNA. The biological mechanisms underlying differential gene regulation can also be explored by coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation with NGS (ChIP-Seq). Using this methodology genome-wide binding sites for transcription factors, RNAP II, epigenetic modifiers and the distribution of modified histones can be assessed. The superior, high-resolution data generated by adopting this sequencing technology allows researchers to distinguish the precise genomic location bound by a protein and correlate this with observed gene expression patterns. Additional methods have also been established to examine other factors influencing gene regulation such as DNA methylation or chromatin conformation on a genome-wide scale. Within any research setting, these techniques can provide relevant data and answer numerous questions about gene expression and regulation. The advances made by pairing NGS with strategic experimental protocols will continue to impact the research community.},

abstract = {Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are fundamental components of the plant innate immune system. MPK3 and MPK6 are Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) MAPKs activated by pathogens and elicitors such as oligogalacturonides (OGs), which function as damage-associated molecular patterns, and flg22, a well-known microbe-associated molecular pattern. However, the specific contribution of MPK3 and MPK6 to the regulation of elicitor-induced defense responses is not completely defined. In this work we have investigated the roles played by these MAPKs in elicitor-induced resistance against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Analysis of single mapk mutants revealed that lack of MPK3 increases basal susceptibility to the fungus, as previously reported, but does not significantly affect elicitor-induced resistance. Instead, lack of MPK6 has no effect on basal resistance but suppresses OG- and flg22-induced resistance to B. cinerea. Overexpression of the AP2C1 phosphatase leads to impaired OG- and flg22-induced phosphorylation of both MPK3 and MPK6, and to phenotypes that recapitulate those of the single mapk mutants. These data indicate that OG- and flg22-induced defense responses effective against B. cinerea are mainly dependent on MAPKs, with a greater contribution of MPK6.},

abstract = {Orthology detection is critically important for accurate functional annotation, and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics. Although various methods are now available, there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the lack of a genomic-scale 'gold standard' orthology dataset. Even in the absence of such datasets, the comparison of results from alternative methodologies contains useful information, as agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a statistical technique that can exploit this information to reasonably infer sensitivities and specificities, and is applied here to evaluate the performance of various orthology detection methods on a eukaryotic dataset. Overall, we observe a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in orthology detection, with BLAST-based methods characterized by high sensitivity, and tree-based methods by high specificity. Two algorithms exhibit the best overall balance, with both sensitivity and specificity>80\%: INPARANOID identifies orthologs across two species while OrthoMCL clusters orthologs from multiple species. Among methods that permit clustering of ortholog groups spanning multiple genomes, the (automated) OrthoMCL algorithm exhibits better within-group consistency with respect to protein function and domain architecture than the (manually curated) KOG database, and the homolog clustering algorithm TribeMCL as well. By way of using LCA, we are also able to comprehensively assess similarities and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate the effects of parameter settings on performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive evaluation of orthology detection on a divergent set of eukaryotic genomes, thus providing insights and guides for method selection, tuning and development for different applications. Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding binary (yes/no) outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making LCA an attractive approach for computational biology.},

Although the phenomenon has been known for years, most progress in our understanding of priming has been made only recently. These studies show that priming often depends on the induced disease resistance key regulator NPR1 (also known as NIM1 or SAI1) and that priming has a major effect on the regulation of cellular plant defence responses.},

However, little is known about the role of AtGRP7 in mediating abscisic acid (ABA) and stress responses. Here, we show that AtGRP7 plays a role in both. AtGRP7 was repressed by ABA, high salt and mannitol. Disruption of AtGRP7 by T-DNA insertion led to hypersensitive responses to ABA in both seed germination and root growth assays. The atgrp7-1 mutant was also hypersensitive to osmotic stress conditions, such as high salt and high concentrations of mannitol. In addition, the atgrp7-1 mutant plants accumulated significantly higher transcript levels of two ABA-and stress-inducible genes, RD29A and RAB18, compared with the wild-type plants. Taken together, these results suggest that AtGRP7 is involved in the regulation of ABA and stress responses.},

abstract = {The model plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 grows and produces necrotic lesions in the leaves of its host, tomato. Both abilities are dependent upon the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (Hrp) type III secretion system (TTSS), which translocates multiple effector proteins into plant cells. A previously constructed DC3000 mutant with a 9.3-kb deletion in the Hrp pathogenicity island conserved effector locus (CEL) was strongly reduced in growth and lesion formation in tomato leaves. The ACEL mutation affects three putative or known effector genes: avrE1, hopM1, and hopAA1-1. Comparison of genomic sequences of DC3000, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A, and P. syringae pv. syringae B728a revealed that these are the only effector genes present in the CEL of all three strains. AvrEl was shown to carry functional TTSS translocation signals based on the performance of a fusion of the first 315 amino acids of AvrE1 to the Cya translocation reporter. A DC3000 delta avrE1 mutant was reduced in its ability to produce lesions but not in its ability to grow in host tomato leaves. AvrE1 expressed from the 35S promoter elicited cell death in nonhost Nicotiana tabacum leaves and host tomato leaves in Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression experiments. Mutations involving combinations of avrE1, hopM1, and hopAA1-1 revealed that deletion of both avrE1 and hopM1 reproduced the strongly reduced growth and lesion phenotype of the delta CEL mutant. Furthermore, quantitative assays involving different levels of inoculum and electrolyte leakage revealed that the avrE1/hopM1 and deltaCEL mutants both were partially impaired in their ability to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost N. benthamiana leaves. However, the avrE1/hopM1 mutant was not impaired in its ability to deliver AvrPto1(1-100)-Cya to nonhost N. benthamiana or host tomato leaves during the first 9 h after inoculation. These data suggest that AvrE1 acts within plant cells and promotes lesion formation and that the combined action of AvrE1 and HopM1 is particularly important in promoting bacterial growth in planta.},

However, in 2005, commercial launching of next generation sequencing has made it possible to generate massively parallel and high resolution DNA sequence data. Its usefulness in various genomic applications such as genome-wide detection of SNPs, DNA methylation profiling, mRNA expression profiling, whole-genome re-sequencing and so on are now well recognized. There are several platforms for generating next generation sequencing (NGS) data which we briefly discuss in this mini overview. With new technologies come new challenges for the data analysts. This mini review attempts to present a collection of selected topics in the current development of statistical methods dealing with these novel data types. We believe that knowing the advances and bottlenecks of this technology will help the researchers to benchmark the analytical tools dealing with these data and will pave the path for its proper application into clinical diagnostics.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing has become an important tool for genome-wide quantification of DNA and RNA. However, a major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome. Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE).

RESULTS: We generated 16 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results overall. We find that even after masking, approximately 5-10\% of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs removes 40\% of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of applications involving detection of alternate alleles from short-read sequence data.

AVAILABILITY: Scripts, written in Perl and R, for simulating short reads, masking SNP variation in a reference genome and analyzing the simulation output are available upon request from JFD. Raw short read data were deposited in GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE18156.

abstract = {Plant innate immunity is activated on the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cell surface, or of pathogen effector proteins inside the plant cell. Together, PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity constitute powerful defences against various phytopathogens. Pathogenic bacteria inject a variety of effector proteins into the host cell to assist infection or propagation. A number of effector proteins have been shown to inhibit plant immunity, but the biochemical basis remains unknown for the vast majority of these effectors. Here we show that the Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris type III effector AvrAC enhances virulence and inhibits plant immunity by specifically targeting Arabidopsis BIK1 and RIPK, two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases known to mediate immune signalling. AvrAC is a uridylyl transferase that adds uridine 5'-monophosphate to and conceals conserved phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of BIK1 and RIPK, reducing their kinase activity and consequently inhibiting downstream signalling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) form an abundant class of transcripts, but the function of the majority of them remains elusive. While it has been shown that some lncRNAs are bound by ribosomes, it has also been convincingly demonstrated that these transcripts do not code for proteins. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which lncRNAs bind ribosomes, we performed systematic RNA sequencing on ribosome-associated RNA pools obtained through ribosomal fractionation and compared the RNA content with nuclear and (non-ribosome bound) cytosolic RNA pools.

RESULTS: The RNA composition of the subcellular fractions differs significantly from each other, but lncRNAs are found in all locations. A subset of specific lncRNAs is enriched in the nucleus but surprisingly the majority is enriched in the cytosol and in ribosomal fractions. The ribosomal enriched lncRNAs include H19 and TUG1.

CONCLUSIONS: Most studies on lncRNAs have focused on the regulatory function of these transcripts in the nucleus. We demonstrate that only a minority of all lncRNAs are nuclear enriched. Our findings suggest that many lncRNAs may have a function in cytoplasmic processes, and in particular in ribosome complexes.},

Crossing and comparing such heterogeneous and disparate data will help improving functional annotation of genomes. This requires designing elaborate integration systems such as warehouses for storing and querying these data.

RESULTS: We have designed a relational genomic warehouse with an original multi-layer architecture made of a databases layer and an entities layer. We describe a new querying module, GenoQuery, which is based on this architecture. We use the entities layer to define mixed queries. These mixed queries allow searching for instances of biological entities and their properties in the different databases, without specifying in which database they should be found. Accordingly, we further introduce the central notion of alternative queries. Such queries have the same meaning as the original mixed queries, while exploiting complementarities yielded by the various integrated databases of the warehouse. We explain how GenoQuery computes all the alternative queries of a given mixed query. We illustrate how useful this querying module is by means of a thorough example.

abstract = {Innate immunity, an ancient form of defense against microbial infection, is well described for animals and is also suggested to be important for plants. Discrimination from self is achieved through receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) not found in the host. PAMPs are evolutionarily conserved structures which are functionally important and, thus, not subject to frequent mutation. Here we report that the previously described peptide elicitor of defense responses in parsley, Pep-13, constitutes a surface-exposed fragment within a novel calcium-dependent cell wall transglutaminase (TGase) from Phytophthora sojae. TGase transcripts and TGase activity are detectable in all Phytophthora species analyzed, among which are some of the most destructive plant pathogens. Mutational analysis within Pep-13 identified the same amino acids indispensable for both TGase and defense-eliciting activity. Pep-13, conserved among Phytophthora TGases, activates defense in parsley and potato, suggesting its function as a genus-specific recognition determinant for the activation of plant defense in host and non-host plants. In summary, plants may recognize PAMPs with characteristics resembling those known to trigger innate immune responses in animals.},

abstract = {Some inter- and intraspecific crosses may result in reduced viability or sterility in the offspring, often due to genetic incompatibilities resulting from interactions between two or more loci. Hybrid necrosis is a postzygotic genetic incompatibility that is phenotypically manifested as necrotic lesions on the plant. We observed hybrid necrosis in interspecific lettuce (Lactuca sativa and Lactuca saligna) hybrids that correlated with resistance to downy mildew. Segregation analysis revealed a specific allelic combination at two interacting loci to be responsible. The allelic interaction had two consequences: (1) a quantitative temperature-dependent autoimmunity reaction leading to necrotic lesions, lethality, and quantitative resistance to an otherwise virulent race of Bremia lactucae; and (2) a qualitative temperature-independent race-specific resistance to an avirulent race of B. lactucae. We demonstrated by transient expression and silencing experiments that one of the two interacting genes was Rin4. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RIN4 is known to interact with multiple R gene products, and their interactions result in hypersensitive resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Site-directed mutation studies on the necrosis-eliciting allele of Rin4 in lettuce showed that three residues were critical for hybrid necrosis.},

abstract = {Since the leaf apoplast is a primary habitat for many plant pathogens, apoplastic proteins are potent, ancient targets for apoplastic effectors secreted by plant pathogens. So far, however, only a few apoplastic effector targets have been identified and characterized. Here, we discovered that the papain-like cysteine protease C14 is a new common target of EPIC1 and EPIC2B, two apoplastic, cystatin-like proteins secreted by the potato (Solanum tuberosum) late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. C14 is a secreted protease of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and potato typified by a carboxyl-terminal granulin domain. The EPIC-C14 interaction occurs at a wide pH range and is stronger than the previously described interactions of EPICs with tomato defense proteases PIP1 and RCR3. The selectivity of the EPICs is also different when compared with the AVR2 effector of the fungal tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum, which targets PIP1 and RCR3, and only at apoplastic pH. Importantly, silencing of C14 increased susceptibility to P. infestans, demonstrating that this protease plays a role in pathogen defense. Although C14 is under conservative selection in tomato, it is under diversifying selection in wild potato species (Solanum demissum, Solanum verrucosum, and Solanum stoliniferum) that are the natural hosts of P. infestans. These data reveal a novel effector target in the apoplast that contributes to immunity and is under diversifying selection, but only in the natural host of the pathogen.},

abstract = {To integrate heterogeneous and large omics data constitutes not only a conceptual challenge but a practical hurdle in the daily analysis of omics data. With the rise of novel omics technologies and through large-scale consortia projects, biological systems are being further investigated at an unprecedented scale generating heterogeneous and often large data sets. These data-sets encourage researchers to develop novel data integration methodologies. In this introduction we review the definition and characterize current efforts on data integration in the life sciences. We have used a web-survey to assess current research projects on data-integration to tap into the views, needs and challenges as currently perceived by parts of the research community.},

abstract = {The lysin motif (LysM) domain is an ancient and ubiquitous protein module that binds peptidoglycan and structurally related molecules. A genomic survey in a large number of species spanning all kingdoms reveals that the combination of LysM and receptor kinase domains is present exclusively in plants. However, the particular biological functions and molecular evolution of this gene family remain largely unknown. We show that LysM domains in plant LysM proteins are highly diversified and that a minimum of six distinct types of LysM motifs exist in plant LysM kinase proteins and five additional types of LysM motifs exist in nonkinase plant LysM proteins. Further, motif similarities suggest that plant LysM motifs are ancient. Although phylogenetic signals are not sufficient to resolve the earliest relationships, plant LysM motifs may have arisen through common ancestry with LysM motifs in other kingdoms. Within plants, the gene family has evolved through local and segmental duplications. The family has undergone further duplication and diversification in legumes, where some LysM kinase genes function as receptors for bacterial nodulation factor. Two pairs of homeologous regions were identified in soybean (Glycine max) based on microsynteny and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Expression data show that most plant LysM kinase genes are expressed predominantly in the root and that orthologous LysM kinase genes share similar tissue expression patterns. We also examined synteny around plant LysM kinase genes to help reconstruct scenarios for the evolution of this important gene family.},

Here we describe Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD), a method for objectively integrating many diverse annotations into a single measure (C score) for each variant. We implement CADD as a support vector machine trained to differentiate 14.7 million high-frequency human-derived alleles from 14.7 million simulated variants. We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes. The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious and pathogenic variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures is unmatched by any current single-annotation method.},

abstract = {The Guard Model for disease resistance postulates that plant resistance proteins act by monitoring (guarding) the target of their corresponding pathogen effector. We posit, however, that guarded effector targets are evolutionarily unstable in plant populations polymorphic for resistance (R) genes. Depending on the absence or presence of the R gene, guarded effector targets are subject to opposing selection forces (1) to evade manipulation by effectors (weaker interaction) and (2) to improve perception of effectors (stronger interaction). Duplication of the effector target gene or independent evolution of a target mimic could relax evolutionary constraints and result in a decoy that would be solely involved in effector perception. There is growing support for this Decoy Model from four diverse cases of effector perception involving Pto, Bs3, RCR3, and RIN4. We discuss the differences between the Guard and Decoy Models and their variants, hypothesize how decoys might have evolved, and suggest ways to challenge the Decoy Model.},

@article{Jelenska2010,
abstract = {Plant heat shock protein Hsp70 is the major target of HopI1, a virulence effector of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae. Hsp70 is essential for the virulence function of HopI1. HopI1 directly binds Hsp70 through its C-terminal J domain and stimulates Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis activity in vitro. In plants, HopI1 forms large complexes in association with Hsp70 and induces and recruits cytosolic Hsp70 to chloroplasts, the site of HopI1 localization. Deletion of a central P/Q-rich repeat region disrupts HopI1 virulence but not Hsp70 interactions or association with chloroplasts. Thus, HopI1 must not only bind Hsp70 through its J domain, but likely actively affects Hsp70 activity and/or specificity. At high temperature, HopI1 is dispensable for P. syringae pathogenicity, unless excess Hsp70 is provided. A working hypothesis is that Hsp70 has a defense-promoting activity(s) that HopI1 or high temperature can subvert. Enhanced susceptibility of Hsp70-depleted plants to nonpathogenic strains of P. syringae supports a defense-promoting role for Hsp70.},

abstract = {We unravel how functional plasticity and redundancy are essential mechanisms underlying the ability to survive of metabolic networks. We perform an exhaustive computational screening of synthetic lethal reaction pairs in Escherichia coli in a minimal medium and we find that synthetic lethal pairs divide in two different groups depending on whether the synthetic lethal interaction works as a backup or as a parallel use mechanism, the first corresponding to essential plasticity and the second to essential redundancy. In E. coli, the analysis of pathways entanglement through essential redundancy supports the view that synthetic lethality affects preferentially a single function or pathway. In contrast, essential plasticity, the dominant class, tends to be inter-pathway but strongly localized and unveils Cell Envelope Biosynthesis as an essential backup for Membrane Lipid Metabolism. When comparing E. coli and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we find that the metabolic networks of the two organisms exhibit a large difference in the relative importance of plasticity and redundancy which is consistent with the conjecture that plasticity is a sophisticated mechanism that requires a complex organization. Finally, coessential reaction pairs are explored in different environmental conditions to uncover the interplay between the two mechanisms. We find that synthetic lethal interactions and their classification in plasticity and redundancy are basically insensitive to medium composition, and are highly conserved even when the environment is enriched with nonessential compounds or overconstrained to decrease maximum biomass formation.},

abstract = {Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is high (>40\% for long alignments). The signal gets blurred in the twilight zone of 20-35\% sequence identity. Here, more than a million sequence alignments were analysed between protein pairs of known structures to re-define a line distinguishing between true and false positives for low levels of similarity. Four results stood out. (i) The transition from the safe zone of sequence alignment into the twilight zone is described by an explosion of false negatives. More than 95\% of all pairs detected in the twilight zone had different structures. More precisely, above a cut-off roughly corresponding to 30\% sequence identity, 90\% of the pairs were homologous; below 25\% less than 10\% were. (ii) Whether or not sequence homology implied structural identity depended crucially on the alignment length. For example, if 10 residues were similar in an alignment of length 16 (>60\%), structural similarity could not be inferred. (iii) The 'more similar than identical' rule (discarding all pairs for which percentage similarity was lower than percentage identity) reduced false positives significantly. (iv) Using intermediate sequences for finding links between more distant families was almost as successful: pairs were predicted to be homologous when the respective sequence families had proteins in common. All findings are applicable to automatic database searches.},

Here we trace Y evolution across 15 representative mammals on the basis of high-throughput genome and transcriptome sequencing. We uncover three independent sex chromosome originations in mammals and birds (the outgroup). The original placental and marsupial (therian) Y, containing the sex-determining gene SRY, emerged in the therian ancestor approximately 180 million years ago, in parallel with the first of five monotreme Y chromosomes, carrying the probable sex-determining gene AMH. The avian W chromosome arose approximately 140 million years ago in the bird ancestor. The small Y/W gene repertoires, enriched in regulatory functions, were rapidly defined following stratification (recombination arrest) and erosion events and have remained considerably stable. Despite expression decreases in therians, Y/W genes show notable conservation of proto-sex chromosome expression patterns, although various Y genes evolved testis-specificities through differential regulatory decay. Thus, although some genes evolved novel functions through spatial/temporal expression shifts, most Y genes probably endured, at least initially, because of dosage constraints.},

Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions.

abstract = {Pathogens use specialized secretion systems and targeting signals to translocate effector proteins inside host cells, a process that is essential for promoting disease and parasitism. However, the amino acid sequences that determine host delivery of eukaryotic pathogen effectors remain mostly unknown. The Crinkler (CRN) proteins of oomycete plant pathogens, such as the Irish potato famine organism Phytophthora infestans, are modular proteins with predicted secretion signals and conserved N-terminal sequence motifs. Here, we provide direct evidence that CRN N termini mediate protein transport into plant cells. CRN host translocation requires a conserved motif that is present in all examined plant pathogenic oomycetes, including the phylogenetically divergent species Aphanomyces euteiches that does not form haustoria, specialized infection structures that have been implicated previously in delivery of effectors. Several distinct CRN C termini localized to plant nuclei and, in the case of CRN8, required nuclear accumulation to induce plant cell death. These results reveal a large family of ubiquitous oomycete effector proteins that target the host nucleus. Oomycetes appear to have acquired the ability to translocate effector proteins inside plant cells relatively early in their evolution and before the emergence of haustoria. Finally, this work further implicates the host nucleus as an important cellular compartment where the fate of plant-microbe interactions is determined.},

abstract = {LRR-containing proteins are present in over 2000 proteins from viruses to eukaryotes. Most LRRs are 20-30 amino acids long, and the repeat number ranges from 2 to 42. The known structures of 14 LRR proteins, each containing 4-17 repeats, have revealed that the LRR domains fold into a horseshoe (or arc) shape with a parallel beta-sheet on the concave face and with various secondary structures, including alpha-helix, 3(10)-helix, and pII helix on the convex face. We developed simple methods to charactere quantitatively the arc shape of LRR and then applied them to all known LRR proteins. A quantity of 2Rsin(phi/2), in which R and phi are the radii of the LRR arc and the rotation angle about the central axis per repeating unit, respectively, is highly conserved in all the LRR proteins regardless of a large variety of repeat number and the radius of the LRR arc. The radii of the LRR arc with beta-alpha structural units are smaller than those with beta-3(10) or beta-pII units. The concave face of the LRR beta-sheet forms a surface analogous to a part of a M\"{o}bius strip.},

Therefore mechanisms capable of policing changes in the cell wall, signaling cellular responses including those that would feedback regulate cell wall properties are expected to play important roles in facilitating growth and ensuring survival. Discoveries in the last few years that the Arabidopsis THESEUS 1 receptor-like kinase (RLK) may function as a sensor for cell wall defects to regulate growth and that its relatives FERONIA and ANXURs regulate pollen tube integrity imply strongly that they play key roles in cell wall-related processes. Furthermore, FERONIA acts as a cell surface regulator for RAC/ROP GTPases and activates production of reactive oxygen species which are, respectively, important molecular switches and mediators for diverse processes. These findings position the THESEUS 1/FERONIA family RLKs as surface regulators and potential cell wall sensors capable of broadly and profoundly impacting cellular pathways in response to diverse signals.},

abstract = {Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) are 20–29-residue sequence motifs present in a number of proteins with diverse functions. The primary function of these motifs appears to be to provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein–protein interactions. The past two years have seen an explosion of new structural information on proteins with LRRs. The new structures represent different LRR subfamilies and proteins with diverse functions, including GTPase-activating protein rna1p from the ribonuclease-inhibitor-like subfamily; spliceosomal protein U2A′, Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, internalin B, dynein light chain 1 and nuclear export protein TAP from the SDS22-like subfamily; Skp2 from the cysteine-containing subfamily; and YopM from the bacterial subfamily. The new structural information has increased our understanding of the structural determinants of LRR proteins and our ability to model such proteins with unknown structures, and has shed new light on how these proteins participate in protein–protein interactions.},

abstract = {Plant growth is dictated by both developmental and environmental cues, many of which are perceived by receptor-like kinases (RLKs). In Arabidopsis, there are more than 600 RLKs; but the functions of most of them are unknown. We recently found that several members of CrRLK1L family RLKs are regulated by plant steroid hormone Brassinosteroids (BRs). Two of the RLKs, FERONIA (FER) and THESEUS1 (THE1) have been previously found to inhibit cell elongation during pollen tube/synergid cell recognition and in sensing cell wall integrity after damage, respectively. However, we found that HERCULES1 (HERK1), another member in the family, as well as THE1 and FER, are regulated by BRs and required for cell elongation during vegetative growth. Here we provide additional evidence for the regulation of the family members by BR effector protein BES1. We also show that another member in the family, designated as HERCULES2 (HERK2), functions redundantly with HERK1 and THE1 to promote stem elongation. Our results, together with those from others, provide compelling evidence that the CrRLK1L family members play important role in plant growth.},

We start the process by mapping array probes to genomic coordinates. The coordinates represent an implicit link between the probes and multiple genomic elements, such as genes, transcripts, miRNA, and repetitive elements, which are represented using concepts in SO. We then use the RDF Query Language (SPARQL) to create explicit links between the probes and the elements. We show how the approach allows us to easily determine the element coverage and genomic overlap of the two array designs. We believe that the method will ultimately be useful for integration of cancer data across multiple omic studies.

These mutations generate de novo consensus binding motifs for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, and in reporter assays, the mutations increased transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by two- to fourfold. Examination of 150 cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 24 cases (16\%), with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.},

abstract = {Potato is the world's fourth largest food crop yet it continues to endure late blight, a devastating disease caused by the Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Breeding broad-spectrum disease resistance (R) genes into potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the best strategy for genetically managing late blight but current approaches are slow and inefficient. We used a repertoire of effector genes predicted computationally from the P. infestans genome to accelerate the identification, functional characterization, and cloning of potentially broad-spectrum R genes. An initial set of 54 effectors containing a signal peptide and a RXLR motif was profiled for activation of innate immunity (avirulence or Avr activity) on wild Solanum species and tentative Avr candidates were identified. The RXLR effector family IpiO induced hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. stoloniferum, S. papita and the more distantly related S. bulbocastanum, the source of the R gene Rpi-blb1. Genetic studies with S. stoloniferum showed cosegregation of resistance to P. infestans and response to IpiO. Transient co-expression of IpiO with Rpi-blb1 in a heterologous Nicotiana benthamiana system identified IpiO as Avr-blb1. A candidate gene approach led to the rapid cloning of S. stoloniferum Rpi-sto1 and S. papita Rpi-pta1, which are functionally equivalent to Rpi-blb1. Our findings indicate that effector genomics enables discovery and functional profiling of late blight R genes and Avr genes at an unprecedented rate and promises to accelerate the engineering of late blight resistant potato varieties.},

abstract = {Fungal and oomycete plant pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells to establish infection. However, virulence targets and modes of action of their effectors are unknown. Effector AVR3a from potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans is translocated into host cells and occurs in two forms: AVR3a(KI), which is detected by potato resistance protein R3a, strongly suppresses infestin 1 (INF1)-triggered cell death (ICD), whereas AVR3a(EM), which evades recognition by R3a, weakly suppresses host ICD. Here we show that AVR3a interacts with and stabilizes host U-box E3 ligase CMPG1, which is required for ICD. In contrast, AVR3a(KI/Y147del), a mutant with a deleted C-terminal tyrosine residue that fails to suppress ICD, cannot interact with or stabilize CMPG1. CMPG1 is stabilized by the inhibitors MG132 and epoxomicin, indicating that it is degraded by the 26S proteasome. CMPG1 is degraded during ICD. However, it is stabilized by mutations in the U-box that prevent its E3 ligase activity. In stabilizing CMPG1, AVR3a thus modifies its normal activity. Remarkably, given the potential for hundreds of effector genes in the P. infestans genome, silencing Avr3a compromises P. infestans pathogenicity, suggesting that AVR3a is essential for virulence. Interestingly, Avr3a silencing can be complemented by in planta expression of Avr3a(KI) or Avr3a(EM) but not the Avr3a(KI/Y147del) mutant. Our data provide genetic evidence that AVR3a is an essential virulence factor that targets and stabilizes the plant E3 ligase CMPG1, potentially to prevent host cell death during the biotrophic phase of infection.},

abstract = {The EST division of GenBank, dbEST, is widely used in many applications such as gene discovery and verification of exon-intron structure. However, the use of EST sequences in the dbEST libraries is often hampered by inconsistent terminology used to describe the library sources and by the presence of contaminated sequences. Here, we describe CleanEST, a novel database server that classified dbEST libraries and removes contaminants. We classified all dbEST libraries according to species and sequencing center. In addition, we further classified human EST libraries by anatomical and pathological systems according to eVOC ontologies. For each dbEST library, we provide two different cleansed sequences: 'pre-cleansed' and 'user-cleansed'. To generate pre-cleansed sequences, we cleansed sequences in dbEST by alignment of EST sequences against well-known contamination sources: UniVec, Escherichia coli, mitochondria and chloroplast (for plant). To provide user-cleansed sequences, we built an automatic user-cleansing pipeline, in which sequences of a user-selected library are cleansed on-the-fly according to user-selected options. The server is available at http://cleanest.kobic.re.kr/ and the database is updated monthly.},

abstract = {Conserved microbial molecules known as PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) elicit defence responses in plants through extracellular receptor proteins. One important PAMP is the flagellin protein derived from motile bacteria. We show here that the solanaceous species Nicotiana benthamiana perceives the flagellin proteins of both pathogenic and non-host species of Pseudomonas syringae. The response to flagellin required a gene closely related to that encoding the Arabidopsis thaliana flagellin receptor that we designated NbFls2. In addition, silencing of NbFls2 led to increased growth of compatible, non-host and non-pathogenic strains of P. syringae. Thus, flagellin perception restricts growth of P. syringae strains on N. benthamiana. Pathogenic bacteria secrete effector proteins into the plant cell to enhance virulence. We tested the ability of several unrelated effectors to suppress PAMP-mediated defences. The effector proteins AvrPto and AvrPtoB, but not AvrRps4, suppressed all responses tested including the hypersensitive response induced by non-host flagellins and the oomycete elicitor INF1. Strikingly, transient expression of avrPto or avrPtoB stimulated the growth of non-pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciensin planta, suggesting that multiplication of this species is also restricted by PAMP perception. Unexpectedly, AvrPtoB but not AvrPto required the defence-associated genes Rar1, Sgt1 and Eds1 for suppression. This observation separates the respective mechanisms of the two effectors, and suggests that AvrPtoB may target the defence machinery directly for its suppressive effect.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {In pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI), plant cell surface receptors sense potential microbial pathogens by recognizing elicitors called PAMPs. Although diverse PAMPs trigger PTI through distinct receptors, the resulting intracellular responses overlap extensively. Despite this, a common component(s) linking signal perception with transduction remains unknown. In this study, we identify SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK)3/brassinosteroid-associated kinase (BAK)1, a receptor-like kinase previously implicated in hormone signaling, as a component of plant PTI. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSERK3/BAK1 rapidly enters an elicitor-dependent complex with FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2), the receptor for the bacterial PAMP flagellin and its peptide derivative flg22. In the absence of AtSERK3/BAK1, early flg22-dependent responses are greatly reduced in both A. thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, N. benthamiana Serk3/Bak1 is required for full responses to unrelated PAMPs and, importantly, for restriction of bacterial and oomycete infections. Thus, SERK3/BAK1 appears to integrate diverse perception events into downstream PAMP responses, leading to immunity against a range of invading microbes.},

abstract = {Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are molecular signatures typical of whole classes of microbes, and their recognition plays a key role in innate immunity. Endogenous elicitors are similarly recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This review focuses on the diversity of MAMPs/DAMPs and on progress to identify the corresponding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants. The two best-characterized MAMP/PRR pairs, flagellin/FLS2 and EF-Tu/EFR, are discussed in detail and put into a phylogenetic perspective. Both FLS2 and EFR are leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). Upon treatment with flagellin, FLS2 forms a heteromeric complex with BAK1, an LRR-RK that also acts as coreceptor for the brassinolide receptor BRI1. The importance of MAMP/PRR signaling for plant immunity is highlighted by the finding that plant pathogens use effectors to inhibit PRR complexes or downstream signaling events. Current evidence indicates that MAMPs, DAMPs, and effectors are all perceived as danger signals and induce a stereotypic defense response.},

abstract = {Background: Trace quantities of contaminating DNA are widespread in the laboratory environment, but their presence has received little attention in the context of high throughput sequencing. This issue is highlighted by recent works that have rested controversial claims upon sequencing data that appear to support the presence of unexpected exogenous species. Results: I used reads that preferentially aligned to alternate genomes to infer the distribution of potential contaminant species in a set of independent sequencing experiments. I confirmed that dilute samples are more exposed to contaminating DNA, and, focusing on four single-cell sequencing experiments, found that these contaminants appear to originate from a wide diversity of clades. Although negative control libraries prepared from "blank" samples recovered the highest-frequency contaminants, low-frequency contaminants, which appeared to make heterogeneous contributions to samples prepared in parallel within a single experiment, were not well controlled for. I used these results to show that, despite heavy replication and plausible controls, contamination can explain all of the observations used to support a recent claim that complete genes pass from food to human blood. Conclusions: Contamination must be considered a potential source of signals of exogenous species in sequencing data, even if these signals are replicated in independent experiments, vary across conditions, or indicate a species which seems a priori unlikely to contaminate. Negative control libraries processed in parallel are essential to control for contaminant DNAs, but their limited ability to recover low-frequency contaminants must be recognized.},

There are many technical challenges in the construction and alignment of reads to a personal diploid genome sequence that we address, for example, bias of reads mapping to the reference allele. We have applied AlleleSeq to variation data for NA12878 from the 1000 Genomes Project as well as matched, deeply sequenced RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data sets generated for this purpose. In addition to observing fairly widespread allele-specific behavior within individual functional genomic data sets (including results consistent with X-chromosome inactivation), we can study the interaction between ASE and ASB. Furthermore, we investigate the coordination between ASE and ASB from multiple transcription factors events using a regulatory network framework. Correlation analyses and network motifs show mostly coordinated ASB and ASE.},

Here, we investigated the role C14-EPIC-like interactions in the natural pathosystem of Arabidopsis with the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). In contrast to the Pinf-solanaceae pathosystem, the C14 orthologous protease of Arabidopsis, RD21, does not evolve under diversifying selection in Arabidopsis, and rd21 null mutants do not show phenotypes upon compatible and incompatible Hpa interactions, despite the evident lack of a major leaf protease. Hpa isolates express highly conserved EPIC-like proteins during infections, but it is unknown if these HpaEPICs can inhibit RD21 and one of these HpaEPICs even lacks the canonical cystatin motifs. The rd21 mutants are unaffected in compatible and incompatible interactions with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, but are significantly more susceptible for the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, demonstrating that RD21 provides immunity to a necrotrophic pathogen.},

Information technology and data exchange standards enable rapid extraction, summarization, and visualization of information and derived knowledge from these data sets. Clinical trials data was extracted in the XML format from the National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov site. This data includes categories such as 'Summary of Purpose', 'Trial Sponsor', 'Phase of the Trial', 'Recruiting Status', and 'Location'. We focused on 645 clinical trials related to cancer vaccines. Additional facts on cancer types, including incidence and survival rates, were retrieved from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance data.

RESULTS: This application enables rapid extraction of information about institutions, diseases, clinical approaches, clinical trials dates, predominant cancer types in the trials, clinical opportunities and pharmaceutical market coverage. Presentation of results is facilitated by visualization tools that summarize the landscape of ongoing and completed cancer vaccine trials. Our summaries show the number of clinical vaccine trials per cancer type, over time, by phase, by lead sponsors, as well as trial activity relative to cancer type and survival data. We also have identified cancers that are neglected in the cancer vaccine field: bladder, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and all of the low-incidence cancers.

CONCLUSION: We have developed a data mining approach that enables rapid extraction of complex data from the major clinical trial repository. Summarization and visualization of these data represents a cost-effective means of making informed decisions about future cancer vaccine clinical trials.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type III secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. In P. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the Hrp (type III secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and Hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. The hrp/hrc genes of P. syringae pv syringae 61, P. syringae pv syringae B728a, and P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic Hrp pathogenicity island (Pai) that is linked to a tRNA(Leu) gene found also in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to Hrp system genes. Cosmid pHIR11 carries a portion of the strain 61 Hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens to inject HopPsyA into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. Large deletions in strain DC3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor role in growth in tomato. P. syringae secretes HopPsyA and AvrPto in culture in a Hrp-dependent manner at pH and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. AvrPto is also secreted by Yersinia enterocolitica. The secretion of AvrPto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an Npt reporter from Y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal targeting signal is recognized by the type III secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.},

abstract = {Previous analysis of transcriptional changes after elicitation of Cf-9 transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) by Avr9 peptide revealed a rapidly upregulated gene, ACRE276. We show that ACRE276 is transiently induced in wounded leaves within 15 min, but upon Avr9 elicitor treatment, this upregulation is enhanced and maintained until cell death onset in Cf-9 tobacco. ACRE276 RNA interference (RNAi) silencing in tobacco results in loss of hypersensitive response (HR) specified by Cf resistance genes. ACRE276 RNAi plants are also compromised for HR mediated by the tobacco mosaic virus defense elicitor p50. Silencing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) ACRE276 leads to breakdown of Cf-9-specified resistance against Cladosporium fulvum leaf mold. We confirmed that tobacco ACRE276 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase requiring an intact U-box domain. Bioinformatic analyses revealed Arabidopsis thaliana PLANT U-BOX17 (PUB17) and Brassica napus ARC1 as the closest homologs of tobacco ACRE276. Transiently expressing PUB17 in Cf-9 tobacco silenced for ACRE276 restores HR, while mutant PUB17 lacking E3 ligase activity fails to do so, demonstrating that PUB17 ligase activity is crucial for defense signaling. Arabidopsis PUB17 knockout plants are compromised in RPM1- and RPS4-mediated resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato containing avirulence genes AvrB and AvrRPS4, respectively. We identify a conserved class of U-box ARMADILLO repeat E3 ligases that are positive regulators of cell death and defense across the Solanaceae and Brassicaceae.},

This naturally coevolving pathosystem contains an amazing level of genetic diversity in host resistance and pathogen avirulence proteins. Oomycete effectors identified to date contain a targeting motif, RXLR, enabling effector entry into the host cell. The availability of the H. arabidopsidis genome sequence has enabled bioinformatic analyses to identify at least 130 RXLR effectors, potentially used to quell the host's defense mechanism and manipulate other host cellular processes. Currently, these effectors are being used to reveal their targets in the host cell. Eventually this will result in an understanding of the mechanisms used by a pathogen to sustain a biotrophic relationship with a plant.},

abstract = {Multicellular organisms activate immunity upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Chitin is the major component of fungal cell walls, and chitin oligosaccharides act as PAMPs in plant and mammalian cells. Microbial pathogens deliver effector proteins to suppress PAMP-triggered host immunity and to establish infection. Here, we show that the LysM domain-containing effector protein Ecp6 of the fungal plant pathogen Cladosporium fulvum mediates virulence through perturbation of chitin-triggered host immunity. During infection, Ecp6 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides that are released from the cell walls of invading hyphae to prevent elicitation of host immunity. This may represent a common strategy of host immune suppression by fungal pathogens, because LysM effectors are widely conserved in the fungal kingdom.},

Sixteen different p16 germline mutations were found in 21 families, while one germline mutation, Arg24His, was detected in the CDK4 gene. The frequency of p16 gene mutation in our sample (44\%) is among the highest rates yet reported and the CDK4 mutation is the second mutation detected in this gene worldwide.

abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, RegulomeDB, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. RegulomeDB includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from ENCODE and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a GWAS where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

abstract = {Isoflavonoids are ecophysiologically active secondary metabolites of the Leguminosae and known for health-promoting phytoestrogenic functions. Isoflavones are synthesized by 1,2-elimination of water from 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, the first intermediate with the isoflavonoid skeleton, but details of this dehydration have been unclear. We screened the extracts of repeatedly fractionated Escherichia coli expressing a Glycyrrhiza echinata cDNA library for the activity to convert a radiolabeled precursor into formononetin (7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone), and a clone of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID) was isolated. Another HID cDNA was cloned from soybean (Glycine max), based on the sequence information in its expressed sequence tag library. Kinetic studies revealed that G. echinata HID is specific to 2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone, while soybean HID has broader specificity to both 4'-hydroxylated and 4'-methoxylated 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, reflecting the structures of isoflavones contained in each plant species. Strikingly, HID proteins were members of a large carboxylesterase family, of which plant proteins form a monophyletic group and some are assigned defensive functions with no intrinsic catalytic activities identified. Site-directed mutagenesis with soybean HID protein suggested that the characteristic oxyanion hole and catalytic triad are essential for the dehydratase as well as the faint esterase activities. The findings, to our knowledge, represent a new example of recruitment of enzymes of primary metabolism during the molecular evolution of plant secondary metabolism.},

abstract = {Oral administration of propylnitrosourea (PNU) in drinking water induces high incidence of lympho-haemopoietic malignancies in rats. Previously we reported that F344 strain rats were highly susceptible to T-lymphomas, and LE/Stm rats, to erythro- or myeloid leukaemias. For analysis of the genetic factors determining types of diseases, we have established LEXF recombinant inbred strains of rats comprising 23 substrains, each derived from intercross between F344 and LE/Stm rats. Rats of 23 LEXF substrains were given PNU, and the development of tumours was observed. The overall incidence of haemopoietic tumours ranged from 100\% to 66.7\%, and the fractions of T-lymphomas, from 100\% to 4\%, showing a continuous spectrum. Based on the genetic profile published as a strain distribution pattern table for the LEXF, we screened the potential quantitative trait loci involved in determination of the types of disease and length of the latency period. Statistical calculation was performed using the Map Manager QT software developed by Manly. Four loci, on chromosome 4, 7, 10 and 18, were suggested to associate with the T-lymphoma susceptibility and three loci, on chromosome 1, 5 and 16, with the length of the latency period. These putative loci were further examined in backcross (F344 x LE)F1 x LE. Among seven loci suggested by the recombinant inbred study, three loci, on chromosome 5, 7 and 10, were significantly associated with T-lymphomas and another locus on chromosome 1, just weakly. These observations indicate that PNU-induced lymphomagenesis is a multifactorial genetic process involving a number of loci linked with susceptibility and resistance.},

abstract = {Cellular life is a highly redundant complex system; yet, the evolutionary maintenance of the redundancy remains unexplained. Using a systems biology approach, we infer that 37-47\% of metabolic reactions in Escherichia coli and yeast can be individually removed without blocking the production of any biomass component under any nutritional condition. However, the majority of these redundant reactions are preserved because they have differential maximal efficiencies at different conditions or their loss causes an immediate fitness reduction that can only be regained via mutation, drift, and selection in evolution. The remaining redundancies are attributable to pleiotropic effects or recent horizontal gene transfers. We find that E. coli and yeast exhibit opposite relationships between the functional importance and redundancy level of a reaction, which is inconsistent with the conjecture that redundancies are preserved as an adaptation to back up important parts in the system. Interestingly, the opposite relationships can both be recapitulated by a simple model in which the natural environments of the organisms change frequently. Thus, adaptive backup is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the high redundancy of cellular metabolic networks. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that redundant reactions are not kept as backups and that the genetic robustness of metabolic networks is an evolutionary by-product.},

Reactions to the mutant alone included localized deposition of phenolics and callose in papillae, and alterations to the plant cell wall leading to increased electron density. Electron microscopy showed that the localized responses were suppressed in the presence of wild-type bacteria but other wall changes occurred at some sites, involving cellulose-rich ingrowth of the wall. Multiplication of the hrp mutant in mixed inocula was confirmed by tagging 85-10::hrpA22 using immunocytochemical location of AvrBs3 expressed from the plasmid pD36. Elicitors of callose deposition and other wall changes were isolated from the hrcC mutant. Activity in extracts of bacteria was attributed to the presence of high molecular weight lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Wild-type X. campestris pv. vesicatoria suppressed induction of structural changes caused by purified LPS. Results obtained suggest that effector proteins produced by phytopathogenic bacteria and delivered by the type III secretion system may have a key role in suppressing the basal defense responses activated by bacterial LPS, which lead to restricted multiplication of nonpathogens such as hrp mutants.},

abstract = {The central idea of this paper is that innovation systems are a very important determinant of technological change. We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore, it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as ‘functions of innovation systems’. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

abstract = {Bacteria retain certain proteins at their cell envelopes by attaching them in a non-covalent manner to peptidoglycan, using specific protein domains, such as the prominent LysM (Lysin Motif) domain. More than 4000 (Pfam PF01476) proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been found to contain one or more Lysin Motifs. Notably, this collection contains not only truly secreted proteins, but also (outer-)membrane proteins, lipoproteins or proteins bound to the cell wall in a (non-)covalent manner. The motif typically ranges in length from 44 to 65 amino acid residues and binds to various types of peptidoglycan and chitin, most likely recognizing the N-acetylglucosamine moiety. Most bacterial LysM-containing proteins are peptidoglycan hydrolases with various cleavage specificities. Binding of certain LysM proteins to cells of Gram-positive bacteria has been shown to occur at specific sites, as binding elsewhere is hindered by the presence of other cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acids. Interestingly, LysM domains of certain plant kinases enable the plant to recognize its symbiotic bacteria or sense and induce resistance against fungi. This interaction is triggered by chitin-like compounds that are secreted by the symbiotic bacteria or released from fungi, demonstrating an important sensing function of LysMs.},

abstract = {Plants live in complex environments in which they intimately interact with a broad range of microbial pathogens with different lifestyles and infection strategies. The evolutionary arms race between plants and their attackers provided plants with a highly sophisticated defense system that, like the animal innate immune system, recognizes pathogen molecules and responds by activating specific defenses that are directed against the invader. Recent advances in plant immunity research have provided exciting new insights into the underlying defense signaling network. Diverse small-molecule hormones play pivotal roles in the regulation of this network. Their signaling pathways cross-communicate in an antagonistic or synergistic manner, providing the plant with a powerful capacity to finely regulate its immune response. Pathogens, on the other hand, can manipulate the plant's defense signaling network for their own benefit by affecting phytohormone homeostasis to antagonize the host immune response.},

abstract = {The plant basal immune system can detect broadly present microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, also called PAMPs) and induce defenses, but adapted microbes express a suite of effector proteins that often act to suppress these defenses. Plants have evolved other receptors (R proteins) that detect these pathogen effectors and activate strong defenses. Pathogens can subsequently alter or delete their recognized effectors to avoid defense elicitation, at risk of a fitness cost associated with loss of those effectors. Significant research progress is revealing, among other things, mechanisms of MAMP perception, the host defense processes and specific host proteins that pathogen effectors target, the mechanisms of R protein activation, and the ways in which pathogen effector suites and R genes evolve. These findings carry practical ramifications for resistance durability and for future resistance engineering. The present review uses numerous questions to help clarify what we know and to identify areas that are ripe for further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a rapidly increasing amount of de novo genome assembly using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short reads; however, several big challenges remain to be overcome in order for this to be efficient and accurate. SOAPdenovo has been successfully applied to assemble many published genomes, but it still needs improvement in continuity, accuracy and coverage, especially in repeat regions.

FINDINGS: To overcome these challenges, we have developed its successor, SOAPdenovo2, which has the advantage of a new algorithm design that reduces memory consumption in graph construction, resolves more repeat regions in contig assembly, increases coverage and length in scaffold construction, improves gap closing, and optimizes for large genome.

CONCLUSIONS: Benchmark using the Assemblathon1 and GAGE datasets showed that SOAPdenovo2 greatly surpasses its predecessor SOAPdenovo and is competitive to other assemblers on both assembly length and accuracy. We also provide an updated assembly version of the 2008 Asian (YH) genome using SOAPdenovo2. Here, the contig and scaffold N50 of the YH genome were \~{}20.9 kbp and \~{}22 Mbp, respectively, which is 3-fold and 50-fold longer than the first published version. The genome coverage increased from 81.16\% to 93.91\%, and memory consumption was \~{}2/3 lower during the point of largest memory consumption.},

However, successful pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae, have developed countermeasures and inject virulence proteins into the host plant cell to suppress immunity and cause devastating diseases. Despite intensive research efforts, the molecular targets of bacterial virulence proteins that are important for plant disease development have remained obscure. Here, we show that a conserved P. syringae virulence protein, HopM1, targets an immunity-associated protein, AtMIN7, in Arabidopsis thaliana. HopM1 mediates the destruction of AtMIN7 via the host proteasome. Our results illustrate a strategy by which a bacterial pathogen exploits the host proteasome to subvert host immunity and causes infection in plants.},

In Arabidopsis, resistance to infection by strains of Pseudomonas syringae expressing the effector AvrRpt2 requires the plant resistance protein RPS2. AvrRpt2 was identified as a putative cysteine protease that results in the elimination of the Arabidopsis protein RIN4. RIN4 cleavage serves as a signal to activate RPS2-mediated resistance. AvrRpt2 is delivered into the plant cell, where it is activated by a eukaryotic factor that we identify as cyclophilin. This activation of AvrRpt2 is necessary for protease activity.

abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

abstract = {The incidence of skin cancer is increasing by epidemic proportions. Basal cell cancer remains the most common skin neoplasm, and simple excision is generally curative. Squamous cell cancers may be preceded by actinic keratoses-premalignant lesions that are treated with cryotherapy, excision, curettage or topical 5-fluorouracil. While squamous cell carcinoma is usually easily cured with local excision, it may invade deeper structures and metastasize. Aggressive local growth and metastasis are common features of malignant melanoma, which accounts for 75 percent of all deaths associated with skin cancer. Early detection greatly improves the prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions is challenging, although the ABCD and seven-point checklists are helpful in determining which pigmented lesions require excision. Sun exposure remains the most important risk factor for all skin neoplasms. Thus, patients should be taught basic "safe sun" measures: sun avoidance during peak ultraviolet-B hours; proper use of sunscreen and protective clothing; and avoidance of suntanning.},

abstract = {We present an EST sequence assembler that specializes in reconstruction of pristine mRNA transcripts, while at the same time detecting and classifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occuring in different variations thereof. The assembler uses iterative multipass strategies centered on high-confidence regions within sequences and has a fallback strategy for using low-confidence regions when needed. It features special functions to assemble high numbers of highly similar sequences without prior masking, an automatic editor that edits and analyzes alignments by inspecting the underlying traces, and detection and classification of sequence properties like SNPs with a high specificity and a sensitivity down to one mutation per sequence. In addition, it includes possibilities to use incorrectly preprocessed sequences, routines to make use of additional sequencing information such as base-error probabilities, template insert sizes, strain information, etc., and functions to detect and resolve possible misassemblies. The assembler is routinely used for such various tasks as mutation detection in different cell types, similarity analysis of transcripts between organisms, and pristine assembly of sequences from various sources for oligo design in clinical microarray experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of next generation sequencing it has become possible to detect genomic variation on a large scale. However, predicting which genomic variants are damaging to gene function remains a challenge, as knowledge of the effects of genomic variation on gene expression is still limited. Recombinant inbred panels are powerful tools to study the cis and trans effects of genetic variation on molecular phenotypes such as gene expression.

RESULTS: We generated a comprehensive inventory of genomic differences between the two founder strains of the rat HXB/BXH recombinant inbred panel: SHR/OlaIpcv and BN-Lx/Cub. We identified 3.2 million single nucleotide variants, 425,924 small insertions and deletions, 907 copy number changes and 1,094 large structural genetic variants. RNA-sequencing analyses on liver tissue of the two strains identified 532 differentially expressed genes and 40 alterations in transcript structure. We identified both coding and non-coding variants that correlate with differential expression and alternative splicing. Furthermore, structural variants, in particular gene duplications, show a strong correlation with transcriptome alterations.

CONCLUSIONS: We show that the panel is a good model for assessing the genetic basis of phenotypic heterogeneity and for providing insights into possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results reveal a high diversity and complexity underlying quantitative and qualitative transcriptional differences.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

abstract = {The oomycetes form a phylogenetically distinct group of eukaryotic microorganisms that includes some of the most notorious pathogens of plants. Oomycetes accomplish parasitic colonization of plants by modulating host cell defenses through an array of disease effector proteins. The biology of effectors is poorly understood but tremendous progress has been made in recent years. This review classifies and catalogues the effector secretome of oomycetes. Two classes of effectors target distinct sites in the host plant: Apoplastic effectors are secreted into the plant extracellular space, and cytoplasmic effectors are translocated inside the plant cell, where they target different subcellular compartments. Considering that five species are undergoing genome sequencing and annotation, we are rapidly moving toward genome-wide catalogues of oomycete effectors. Already, it is evident that the effector secretome of pathogenic oomycetes is more complex than expected, with perhaps several hundred proteins dedicated to manipulating host cell structure and function.},

@article{Bouwmeester2011,
abstract = {In plants, an active defense against biotrophic pathogens is dependent on a functional continuum between the cell wall (CW) and the plasma membrane (PM). It is thus anticipated that proteins maintaining this continuum also function in defense. The legume-like lectin receptor kinase LecRK-I.9 is a putative mediator of CW-PM adhesions in Arabidopsis and is known to bind in vitro to the Phytophthora infestans RXLR-dEER effector IPI-O via a RGD cell attachment motif present in IPI-O. Here we show that LecRK-I.9 is associated with the plasma membrane, and that two T-DNA insertions lines deficient in LecRK-I.9 (lecrk-I.9) have a 'gain-of-susceptibility' phenotype specifically towards the oomycete Phytophthora brassicae. Accordingly, overexpression of LecRK-I.9 leads to enhanced resistance to P. brassicae. A similar 'gain-of-susceptibility' phenotype was observed in transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing ipiO (35S-ipiO1). This phenocopy behavior was also observed with respect to other defense-related functions; lecrk-I.9 and 35S-ipiO1 were both disturbed in pathogen- and MAMP-triggered callose deposition. By site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the RGD cell attachment motif in IPI-O is not only essential for disrupting the CW-PM adhesions, but also for disease suppression. These results suggest that destabilizing the CW-PM continuum is one of the tactics used by Phytophthora to promote infection. As countermeasure the host may want to strengthen CW-PM adhesions and the novel Phytophthora resistance component LecRK-I.9 seems to function in this process.},

abstract = {Both animals and plants use steroids as signalling molecules during growth and development. Animal steroids are principally recognized by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. In plants, BRI1, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase localized to the plasma membrane, is a critical component of a receptor complex for brassinosteroids. Here, we present the first evidence for direct binding of active brassinosteroids to BRI1 using a biotin-tagged photoaffinity castasterone (BPCS), a biosynthetic precursor of brassinolide (the most active of the brassinosteroids). Binding studies using BPCS, (3)H-labelled brassinolide and recombinant BRI1 fragments show that the minimal binding domain for brassinosteroids consists of a 70-amino acid island domain (ID) located between LRR21 and LRR22 in the extracellular domain of BRI1, together with the carboxy-terminal flanking LRR (ID-LRR22). Our results demonstrate that brassinosteroids bind directly to the 94 amino acids comprising ID-LRR22 in the extracellular domain of BRI1, and define a new binding domain for steroid hormones.},

We have sequenced the SHR/OlaIpcv genome at 10.7-fold coverage by paired-end sequencing on the Illumina platform. We identified 3.6 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the SHR/OlaIpcv and Brown Norway (BN) reference genome, with a high rate of validation (sensitivity 96.3\%-98.0\% and specificity 99\%-100\%). We also identified 343,243 short indels between the SHR/OlaIpcv and reference genomes. These SNPs and indels resulted in 161 gain or loss of stop codons and 629 frameshifts compared with the BN reference sequence. We also identified 13,438 larger deletions that result in complete or partial absence of 107 genes in the SHR/OlaIpcv genome compared with the BN reference and 588 copy number variants (CNVs) that overlap with the gene regions of 688 genes. Genomic regions containing genes whose expression had been previously mapped as cis-regulated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were significantly enriched with SNPs, short indels, and larger deletions, suggesting that some of these variants have functional effects on gene expression. Genes that were affected by major alterations in their coding sequence were highly enriched for genes related to ion transport, transport, and plasma membrane localization, providing insights into the likely molecular and cellular basis of hypertension and other phenotypes specific to the SHR strain. This near complete catalog of genomic differences between two extensively studied rat strains provides the starting point for complete elucidation, at the molecular level, of the physiological and pathophysiological phenotypic differences between individuals from these strains.},

Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},

abstract = {The Pto gene encodes a serine-threonine kinase that confers resistance in tomato to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strains expressing the avirulence gene avrPto. We examined the ability of Pto to function in tobacco, a species that is sexually incompatible with tomato. Evidence that a heterologous Pto-like signal transduction pathway is present in tobacco was suggested by the fact that tobacco line Wisconsin-38 exhibits a hypersensitive response after infection with P. syringae pv tabaci expressing avrPto. We introduced a Pto transgene into cultivar Wisconsin-38 and assessed the ability of transformed plants to further inhibit growth of the P. s. tabaci strain expressing avrPto. The Pto-transformed tobacco plants exhibited a significant increase in resistance to the avirulent P. s. tabaci strain compared with wild-type tobacco as indicated by (1) more rapid development of a hypersensitive resistance response at high inoculum concentrations (108 colony-forming units per mL); (2) lessened severity of disease symptoms at moderate inoculum concentrations (106 and 107 colony-forming units per mL); and (3) reduced growth of avirulent P. s. tabaci in inoculated leaves. The results indicate that essential components of a Pto-mediated signal transduction pathway are conserved in tobacco and should prompt examination of resistance gene function across even broader taxonomic distances.},

In comparison with genomes of related, hemibiotrophic Phytophthora species, the Hpa genome exhibits dramatic reductions in genes encoding (i) RXLR effectors and other secreted pathogenicity proteins, (ii) enzymes for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulfur, and (iii) proteins associated with zoospore formation and motility.

abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

abstract = {Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) belong to the large RLK/Pelle gene family, and it is known that the Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains >600 such members, which play important roles in plant growth, development, and defense responses. Surprisingly, we found that rice (Oryza sativa) has nearly twice as many RLK/Pelle members as Arabidopsis does, and it is not simply a consequence of a larger predicted gene number in rice. From the inferred phylogeny of all Arabidopsis and rice RLK/Pelle members, we estimated that the common ancestor of Arabidopsis and rice had >440 RLK/Pelles and that large-scale expansions of certain RLK/Pelle members and fusions of novel domains have occurred in both the Arabidopsis and rice lineages since their divergence. In addition, the extracellular domains have higher nonsynonymous substitution rates than the intracellular domains, consistent with the role of extracellular domains in sensing diverse signals. The lineage-specific expansions in Arabidopsis can be attributed to both tandem and large-scale duplications, whereas tandem duplication seems to be the major mechanism for recent expansions in rice. Interestingly, although the RLKs that are involved in development seem to have rarely been duplicated after the Arabidopsis-rice split, those that are involved in defense/disease resistance apparently have undergone many duplication events. These findings led us to hypothesize that most of the recent expansions of the RLK/Pelle family have involved defense/resistance-related genes.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopU1 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that is injected into plant cells by the type III protein secretion system. Inside the plant cell it suppresses immunity by modifying RNA-binding proteins including the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein GRP7. The crystal structure of HopU1 at 2.7-Å resolution reveals two unique protruding loops, L1 and L4, not found in other mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that these loops are essential for substrate recognition and enzymatic activity. HopU1 ADP-ribosylates the conserved arginine 49 of GRP7, and this reduces the ability of GRP7 to bind RNA in vitro. In vivo, expression of GRP7 with Arg-49 replaced with lysine does not complement the reduced immune responses of the Arabidopsis thaliana grp7-1 mutant demonstrating the importance of this residue for GRP7 function. These data provide mechanistic details how HopU1 recognizes this novel type of substrate and highlights the role of GRP7 in plant immunity.},

abstract = {Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) elicit basal defense responses in plants, and, in turn, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome these PAMP-induced defenses. To suppress immunity, the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae secretes effector proteins, the biochemical function and virulence targets of which remain largely unknown. We show that HopAI1, an effector widely conserved in both plant and animal bacterial pathogens, inhibits the Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activated by exposure to PAMPs. HopAI1 inactivates MAPKs by removing the phosphate group from phosphothreonine through a unique phosphothreonine lyase activity, which is required for HopAI1 function. The inhibition of MAPKs by HopA1 suppresses two independent downstream events, namely the reinforcement of cell wall defense and transcriptional activation of PAMP response genes. The MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 physically interact with HopAI1 indicating that they are direct targets of HopAI1. These findings uncover a mechanism by which Pseudomonas syringae overcomes host innate immunity to promote pathogenesis.},

abstract = {The flagellum is an important virulence factor for bacteria pathogenic to animals and plants. Here we demonstrate that plants have a highly sensitive chemoperception system for eubacterial flagellins, specifically targeted to the most highly conserved domain within its N terminus. Synthetic peptides comprising 15-22 amino acids of this domain acted as elicitors of defence responses at sub-nanomolar concentrations in cells of tomato and several other plant species. Peptides comprising only the central 8 to 11 amino acids of the active domain had no elicitor activity but acted as specific, competitive inhibitors in tomato cells. These antagonists suppressed the plant's response to flagellin, crude bacterial extracts and living bacterial cells. Thus, plants have a highly sensitive and selective perception system for the flagellin of motile eubacteria.},

abstract = {Resistance in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to infection by Pseudomonas syringae involves both detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and recognition by the host Pto kinase of pathogen effector AvrPtoB which is translocated into the host cell and interferes with PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The N-terminal portion of AvrPtoB is sufficient for its virulence activity and for recognition by Pto. An amino acid substitution in AvrPtoB, F173A, abolishes these activities. To investigate the mechanisms of AvrPtoB virulence, we screened for tomato proteins that interact with AvrPtoB and identified Bti9, a LysM receptor-like kinase. Bti9 has the highest amino acid similarity to Arabidopsis CERK1 among the tomato LysM receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and belongs to a clade containing three other tomato proteins, SlLyk11, SlLyk12, and SlLyk13, all of which interact with AvrPtoB. The F173A substitution disrupts the interaction of AvrPtoB with Bti9 and SlLyk13, suggesting that these LysM-RLKs are its virulence targets. Two independent tomato lines with RNAi-mediated reduced expression of Bti9 and SlLyk13 were more susceptible to P. syringae. Bti9 kinase activity was inhibited in vitro by the N-terminal domain of AvrPtoB in an F173-dependent manner. These results indicate Bti9 and/or SlLyk13 play a role in plant immunity and the N-terminal domain of AvrPtoB may have evolved to interfere with their kinase activity. Finally, we found that Bti9 and Pto interact with AvrPtoB in a structurally similar although not identical fashion, suggesting that Pto may have evolved as a molecular mimic of LysM-RLK kinase domains.},

abstract = {Typically, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are considered to be conserved throughout classes of microbes and to contribute to general microbial fitness, whereas effectors are species, race, or strain specific and contribute to pathogen virulence. Both types of molecule can trigger plant immunity, designated PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered immunity (PTI and ETI, respectively). However, not all microbial defense activators conform to the common distinction between PAMPs and effectors. For example, some effectors display wide distribution, while some PAMPs are rather narrowly conserved or contribute to pathogen virulence. As effectors may elicit defense responses and PAMPs may be required for virulence, single components cannot exclusively be referred to by one of the two terms. Therefore, we put forward that the distinction between PAMPs and effectors, between PAMP receptors and resistance proteins, and, therefore, also between PTI and ETI, cannot strictly be maintained. Rather, as illustrated by examples provided here, there is a continuum between PTI and ETI. We argue that plant resistance is determined by immune receptors that recognize appropriate ligands to activate defense, the amplitude of which is likely determined by the level required for effective immunity.},

abstract = {Bladder cancer-associated protein (BLCAP) is a highly conserved protein among species, and it is considered a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene originally identified from human bladder carcinoma. However, little is known about the regulation or the function of this protein. Here, we show that the human BLCAP transcript undergoes multiple A-to-I editing events. Some of the new editing events alter the highly conserved amino terminus of the protein creating alternative protein isoforms by changing the genetically coded amino acids. We found that both ADAR1 and ADAR2-editing enzymes cooperate to edit this transcript and that different tissues displayed distinctive ratios of edited and unedited BLCAP transcripts. Moreover, we observed a general decrease in BLCAP-editing level in astrocytomas, bladder cancer and colorectal cancer when compared with the related normal tissues. The newly identified editing events, found to be downregulated in cancers, could be useful for future studies as a diagnostic tool to distinguish malignancies or epigenetic changes in different tumors.},

abstract = {The Bladder Cancer-Associated Protein gene (BLCAP; previously BC10) is a tumour suppressor that limits cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis. BLCAP protein or message are downregulated or absent in a variety of human cancers. In mouse and human, the first intron of Blcap/BLCAP contains the distinct Neuronatin (Nnat/NNAT) gene. Nnat is an imprinted gene that is exclusively expressed from the paternally inherited allele. Previous studies found no evidence for imprinting of Blcap in mouse or human. Here we show that Blcap is imprinted in mouse and human brain, but not in other mouse tissues. Moreover, Blcap produces multiple distinct transcripts that exhibit reciprocal allele-specific expression in both mouse and human. We propose that the tissue-specific imprinting of Blcap is due to the particularly high transcriptional activity of Nnat in brain, as has been suggested previously for the similarly organized and imprinted murine Commd1/U2af1-rs1 locus. For Commd1/U2af1-rs1, we show that it too produces distinct transcript variants with reciprocal allele-specific expression. The imprinted expression of BLCAP and its interplay with NNAT at the transcriptional level may be relevant to human carcinogenesis.},

To gain insights into the evolutionary pressures underlying selection for these phenotypes, we sequenced the genomes of 27 rat strains, including 11 models of hypertension, diabetes, and insulin resistance, along with their respective control strains. Altogether, we identified more than 13 million single-nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants across these rat strains. Analysis of strain-specific selective sweeps and gene clusters implicated genes and pathways involved in cation transport, angiotensin production, and regulators of oxidative stress in the development of cardiovascular disease phenotypes in rats. Many of the rat loci that we identified overlap with previously mapped loci for related traits in humans, indicating the presence of shared pathways underlying these phenotypes in rats and humans. These data represent a step change in resources available for evolutionary analysis of complex traits in disease models. PAPERCLIP:},

MK1 and MK2 encode stress-inducible protein kinases that can contribute to the response to wounding, UV-C, and cold. MK1 has a 92\% amino acid identity with WIPK of tobacco. It was transcriptionally induced in response to wounding. In contrast, no detectable MK1 transcript was found in unwounded leaves of pepper. MK2 has a high level of amino acid homology to MAP kinases, such as NTF4 and SIPK and was constitutively expressed in all tissues. Both MK transcripts were downregulated by UV-C treatment. Each MK protein activation was independently wound-inducible in a cultivar dependent manner. MK1 is phosphorylated in cv. Pungchon but not cv. Subicho; whereas, the MK2 protein activation by wounding is restricted to cv. Subicho. In addition, de novo synthesis of the MK1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation was rapidly and transiently induced in cv. Pungchon by wounding. In contrast, it is highly unlikely that the MK1 protein is produced in cv. Subicho, even though there is an abundant expression of MK1 mRNA after wounding in this cultivar. In Escherichia coli, which overexpresses MK1, autophosphorylation is observed at conserved threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites.},

abstract = {Plants and animals rely on innate immunity to prevent infections by detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The plant PRR FLS2, a leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinase, recognizes bacterial flagellin and initiates immune signaling by association with another leucine-rich repeat-receptor-like kinase, BAK1. It remains unknown how the FLS2/BAK1 receptor complex activates intracellular signaling cascades. Here we identified the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 that is rapidly phosphorylated upon flagellin perception, depending on both FLS2 and BAK1. BIK1 associates with FLS2 and BAK1 in vivo and in vitro. BIK1 is phosphorylated by BAK1, and BIK1 also directly phosphorylates BAK1 and FLS2 in vitro. The flagellin phosphorylation site Thr(237) of BIK1 is required for its phosphorylation on BAK1 and FLS2, suggesting that BIK1 is likely first phosphorylated upon flagellin perception and subsequently transphosphorylates FLS2/BAK1 to propagate flagellin signaling. Importantly, bik1 mutants are compromised in diverse flagellin-mediated responses and immunity to the nonpathogenic bacterial infection. Thus, BIK1 is an essential component in MAMP signal transduction, which links the MAMP receptor complex to downstream intracellular signaling.},

abstract = {Endocytic vesicle trafficking is crucial for regulating activity and localization of plasma membrane components, but the process is still poorly genetically defined in plants. Membrane proteins of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family exhibit polar localization in plant cells and facilitate cellular efflux of the plant hormone auxin, thereby regulating multiple developmental processes. PIN proteins undergo constitutive endocytosis and GNOM ARF GEF-dependent recycling, and their localization is under extensive regulation by developmental and environmental cues. We designed a fluorescence imaging-based screen to identify Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in internalization of proteins including PINs from the plasma membrane. We identified three mutant loci, BFA-visualized endocytic trafficking defective1 (ben1) through ben3 that do not efficiently accumulate PIN1-GFP in intracellular compartments after inhibition of recycling and secretion by fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA). Fine mapping revealed that BEN1 encodes an ARF GEF vesicle trafficking regulator from the functionally uncharacterized BIG class. ben1 mutant has been previously implicated in pathogen response and shows cell polarity, BFA sensitivity, and growth defects. BEN1 is involved in endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins and localizes to early endocytic compartments distinct from GNOM-positive endosomes. Our results identify BEN1 as the ARF GEF mediating early endosomal traffic.},

abstract = {To infect plants, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato delivers \~{}30 type III effector proteins into host cells, many of which interfere with PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). One effector, AvrPtoB, suppresses PTI using a central domain to bind host BAK1, a kinase that acts with several pattern recognition receptors to activate defense signaling. A second AvrPtoB domain binds and suppresses the PTI-associated kinase Bti9 but is conversely recognized by the protein kinase Pto to activate effector-triggered immunity. We report the crystal structure of the AvrPtoB-BAK1 complex, which revealed structural similarity between these two AvrPtoB domains, suggesting that they arose by intragenic duplication. The BAK1 kinase domain is structurally similar to Pto, and a conserved region within both BAK1 and Pto interacts with AvrPtoB. BAK1 kinase activity is inhibited by AvrPtoB, and mutations at the interaction interface disrupt AvrPtoB virulence activity. These results shed light on a structural mechanism underlying host-pathogen coevolution.},

Furthermore, RNA-Seq-based transcript profiling can be applied to non-model and newly discovered organisms because it does not require a predefined measuring platform (like e.g. microarrays). However, these novel technologies pose new challenges: the raw data need to be rigorously quality checked and filtered prior to analysis, and proper statistical methods have to be applied to extract biologically relevant information. Given the sheer volume of data, this is no trivial task and requires a combination of considerable technical resources along with bioinformatics expertise. To aid the individual researcher, we have developed RobiNA as an integrated solution that consolidates all steps of RNA-Seq-based differential gene-expression analysis in one user-friendly cross-platform application featuring a rich graphical user interface. RobiNA accepts raw FastQ files, SAM/BAM alignment files and counts tables as input. It supports quality checking, flexible filtering and statistical analysis of differential gene expression based on state-of-the art biostatistical methods developed in the R/Bioconductor projects. In-line help and a step-by-step manual guide users through the analysis.

abstract = {The flagellin receptor of Arabidopsis thaliana, At-FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), has become a model for mechanistic and functional studies on plant immune receptors. Here, we started out with a comparison of At-FLS2 and the orthologous tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) receptor Sl-FLS2. Both receptors specifically responded to picomolar concentrations of the genuine flg22 ligand but proved insensitive to >10(6)-fold higher concentrations of CLV3 peptides that have recently been reported as a second type of ligand for At-FLS2. At-FLS2 and Sl-FLS2 exhibit species-specific differences in the recognition of shortened or sequence-modified flg22 ligands. To map the sites responsible for these species-specific traits on the FLS2 receptors, we performed domain swaps, substituting subsets of the 28 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in At-FLS2 with the corresponding LRRs from Sl-FLS2. We found that the LRRs 7 to 10 of Sl-FLS2 determine the high affinity of Sl-FLS2 for the core part RINSAKDD of flg22. In addition, we discovered importance of the LRRs 19 to 24 for the responsiveness to C-terminally modified flagellin peptides. These results indicate that ligand perception in FLS2 is a complex molecular process that involves LRRs from both the outermost and innermost LRRs of the FLS2 ectodomain.},

Although defense suppression by secreted effector proteins has been well studied in bacteria, equivalent systems in fungi and oomycetes are poorly understood. We report the characterization of SNE1 (suppressor of necrosis 1), a gene encoding a secreted protein from the hemibiotrophic oomycete Phytophthora infestans that is specifically expressed at the transcriptional level during biotrophic growth within the host plant tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Using transient expression assays, we show that SNE1 suppresses the action of secreted cell death-inducing effectors from Phytophthora that are expressed during the necrotrophic growth phase, as well as programmed cell death mediated by a range of Avr-R protein interactions. We also report that SNE1 contains predicted NLS motifs and translocates to the plant nucleus in transient expression studies. A conceptual model is presented in which the sequential coordinated secretion of antagonistic effectors by P. infestans first suppresses, but then induces, host cell death, thereby providing a highly regulated means to control the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy.},

Recent studies corroborate its role in somatic embryogenesis and suggest a broader range of functions in plant response to biotic and abiotic stimuli.

Therefore, deciphering how plants interact with mutualistic and parasitic organisms is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the biology of plants. The field of plant-biotic interactions has recently coalesced around an integrated model. Major classes of molecular players both from plants and their associated organisms have been revealed. These include cell surface and intracellular immune receptors of plants as well as apoplastic and host-cell-translocated (cytoplasmic) effectors of the invading organism. This article focuses on effectors, molecules secreted by plant-associated organisms that alter plant processes. Effectors have emerged as a central class of molecules in our integrated view of plant-microbe interactions. Their study has significantly contributed to advancing our knowledge of plant hormones, plant development, plant receptors, and epigenetics. Many pathogen effectors are extraordinary examples of biological innovation; they include some of the most remarkable proteins known to function inside plant cells. Here, we review some of the key concepts that have emerged from the study of the effectors of plant-associated organisms. In particular, we focus on how effectors function in plant tissues and discuss future perspectives in the field of effector biology.},

Defects in either Klotho or Fgf23 gene expression cause not only phosphate retention but also a premature-aging syndrome in mice, unveiling a potential link between phosphate metabolism and aging. In addition, the extracellular domain of Klotho protein is clipped on the cell surface and secreted into blood stream, potentially functioning as an endocrine factor. The secreted Klotho protein has a putative sialidase activity that modifies glycans on the cell surface, which may explain the ability of secreted Klotho protein to regulate activity of multiple ion channels and growth factors including insulin, IGF-1, and Wnt. Secreted Klotho protein also protects cells and tissues from oxidative stress through a mechanism yet to be identified. Thus, the transmembrane and secreted forms of Klotho protein have distinct functions, which may collectively affect aging processes in mammals.},

We analyze the 2081 breakpoint junctions and infer potential mechanism of origin. Three mechanisms account for the bulk of germline structural variation: microhomology-mediated processes involving short (2-20 bp) stretches of sequence (28\%), nonallelic homologous recombination (22\%), and L1 retrotransposition (19\%). The high quality and long-range continuity of the sequence reveals more complex mutational mechanisms, including repeat-mediated inversions and gene conversion, that are most often missed by other methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, and next-generation sequencing.},

I summarize the major characteristics of each commercially available platform to enable direct comparisons. In terms of cost per megabase (Mb) of sequence, the Illumina and SOLiD platforms are clearly superior (≤ \$0.10/Mb vs. > \$10/Mb for 454 and some Ion Torrent chips). In terms of cost per nonmultiplexed sample and instrument run time, the Pacific Biosciences and Ion Torrent platforms excel, with the 454 GS Junior and Illumina MiSeq also notable in this regard. All platforms allow multiplexing of samples, but details of library preparation, experimental design and data analysis can constrain the options. The wide range of characteristics among available platforms provides opportunities both to conduct groundbreaking studies and to waste money on scales that were previously infeasible.

abstract = {Since the early 1980s, various strains of the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae have been used as models for understanding plant-bacterial interactions. In 1991, a P. syringae pathovar tomato (Pst) strain, DC3000, was reported to infect not only its natural host tomato but also Arabidopsis in the laboratory, a finding that spurred intensive efforts in the subsequent two decades to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this strain causes disease in plants. Genomic analysis shows that Pst DC3000 carries a large repertoire of potential virulence factors, including proteinaceous effectors that are secreted through the type III secretion system and a polyketide phytotoxin called coronatine, which structurally mimics the plant hormone jasmonate ( JA). Study of Pst DC3000 pathogenesis has not only provided several conceptual advances in understanding how a bacterial pathogen employs type III effectors to suppress plant immune responses and promote disease susceptibility but has also facilitated the discovery of the immune function of stomata and key components of JA signaling in plants. The concepts derived from the study of Pst DC3000 pathogenesis may prove useful in understanding pathogenesis mechanisms of other plant pathogens.

abstract = {If protein evolution is due in large part to slightly deleterious amino acid substitutions, then the rate of evolution should be greater in proteins that contribute less to individual fitness. The rationale for this prediction is that relatively dispensable proteins should be subject to weaker purifying selection, and should therefore accumulate mildly deleterious substitutions more rapidly. Although this argument was presented over twenty years ago, and is fundamental to many applications of evolutionary theory, the prediction has proved difficult to confirm. In fact, a recent study showed that essential mouse genes do not evolve more slowly than non-essential ones. Thus, although a variety of factors influencing the rate of protein evolution have been supported by extensive sequence analysis, the relationship between protein dispensability and evolutionary rate has remained unconfirmed. Here we use the results from a highly parallel growth assay of single gene deletions in yeast to assess protein dispensability, which we relate to evolutionary rate estimates that are based on comparisons of sequences drawn from twenty-one fully annotated genomes. Our analysis reveals a highly significant relationship between protein dispensability and evolutionary rate, and explains why this relationship is not detectable by categorical comparison of essential versus non-essential proteins. The relationship is highly conserved, so that protein dispensability in yeast is also predictive of evolutionary rate in a nematode worm.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference genome or transcriptome, including splicing events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels. We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state.

RESULTS: In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds comparable to existing programs, especially in reads of > or=70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of 1-9 nt and deletions of 1-30 nt. Although SNP tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially, it affects alignment results in 7-8\% of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6\% of 36 nt reads and 3\% of 70 nt reads.

abstract = {Plants use receptor kinases, such as FLS2 and EFR, to perceive bacterial pathogens and initiate innate immunity. This immunity is often suppressed by bacterial effectors, allowing pathogen propagation. To counteract, plants have evolved disease resistance genes that detect the bacterial effectors and reinstate resistance. The Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPto promotes infection in susceptible plants but triggers resistance in plants carrying the protein kinase Pto and the associated resistance protein Prf. Here we show that AvrPto binds receptor kinases, including Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR and tomato LeFLS2, to block plant immune responses in the plant cell. The ability to target receptor kinases is required for the virulence function of AvrPto in plants. The FLS2-AvrPto interaction and Pto-AvrPto interaction appear to share similar sequence requirements, and Pto competes with FLS2 for AvrPto binding. The results suggest that the mechanism by which AvrPto recognizes virulence targets is linked to the evolution of Pto, which, in association with Prf, recognizes the bacterium and triggers strong resistance.},

abstract = {Bacterial, oomycete and fungal plant pathogens establish disease by translocation of effector proteins into host cells, where they may directly manipulate host innate immunity. In bacteria, translocation is through the type III secretion system, but analogous processes for effector delivery are uncharacterized in fungi and oomycetes. Here we report functional analyses of two motifs, RXLR and EER, present in translocated oomycete effectors. We use the Phytophthora infestans RXLR-EER-containing protein Avr3a as a reporter for translocation because it triggers RXLR-EER-independent hypersensitive cell death following recognition within plant cells that contain the R3a resistance protein. We show that Avr3a, with or without RXLR-EER motifs, is secreted from P. infestans biotrophic structures called haustoria, demonstrating that these motifs are not required for targeting to haustoria or for secretion. However, following replacement of Avr3a RXLR-EER motifs with alanine residues, singly or in combination, or with residues KMIK-DDK--representing a change that conserves physicochemical properties of the protein--P. infestans fails to deliver Avr3a or an Avr3a-GUS fusion protein into plant cells, demonstrating that these motifs are required for translocation. We show that RXLR-EER-encoding genes are transcriptionally upregulated during infection. Bioinformatic analysis identifies 425 potential genes encoding secreted RXLR-EER class proteins in the P. infestans genome. Identification of this class of proteins provides unparalleled opportunities to determine how oomycetes manipulate hosts to establish infection.},

Oomycetes secrete effectors that can be active in the host's extracellular environment, for example inhibiting host defence enzymes, or inside host cells where they can interfere with plant processes, in particular suppression of defence. Two classes of effectors are known to be host-translocated: the RXLRs and Crinklers. Many effectors show defence-suppressive activity that is important for pathogen virulence. A striking example is AVR3a of Phytophthora infestans that targets an ubiquitin ligase, the stabilisation of which may prevent host cell death.

abstract = {The gamma-proteobacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 uses the type III secretion system to inject ca. 28 Avr/Hop effector proteins into plants, which enables the bacterium to grow from low inoculum levels to produce bacterial speck symptoms in tomato, Arabidopsis thaliana, and (when lacking hopQ1-1) Nicotiana benthamiana. The effectors are collectively essential but individually dispensable for the ability of the bacteria to defeat defenses, grow, and produce symptoms in plants. Eighteen of the effector genes are clustered in six genomic islands/islets. Combinatorial deletions involving these clusters and two of the remaining effector genes revealed a redundancy-based structure in the effector repertoire, such that some deletions diminished growth in N. benthamiana only in combination with other deletions. Much of the ability of DC3000 to grow in N. benthamiana was found to be due to five effectors in two redundant-effector groups (REGs), which appear to separately target two high-level processes in plant defense: perception of external pathogen signals (AvrPto and AvrPtoB) and deployment of antimicrobial factors (AvrE, HopM1, HopR1). Further support for the membership of HopR1 in the same REG as AvrE was gained through bioinformatic analysis, revealing the existence of an AvrE/DspA/E/HopR effector superfamily, which has representatives in virtually all groups of proteobacterial plant pathogens that deploy type III effectors.},

While these strains have been extensively studied, little information is available about the DA and F344 genomes, as only the BN and SHR strains have been sequenced to date. Here we report the sequencing of the DA and F344 genomes using next-generation Illumina paired-end read technology, and the first de novo assembly of a rat genome. DA and F344 were sequenced with an average depth of 32-fold, covered 98.9\% of the BN reference genome, and included 97.97\% of known rat ESTs. New sequences could be assigned to 59 million positions with previously unknown data in the BN reference genome. Differences between DA, F344 and BN included 19 million positions in novel scaffolds, 4.09 million SNPs (including 1.37 million new SNPs), 458,224 short insertions and deletions, and 58,174 structural variants. Genetic differences between DA, F344, and BN, including high-impact SNPs and short insertions and deletions affecting over 2,500 genes, are likely to account for most of the phenotypic variation between these strains. The new DA and F344 genome sequencing data should facilitate gene discovery efforts in rat models of human disease.},

Here we set out to identify new high-penetrance susceptibility genes by sequencing 184 melanoma cases from 105 pedigrees recruited in the UK, The Netherlands and Australia that were negative for variants in known predisposition genes. We identified families where melanoma cosegregates with loss-of-function variants in the protection of telomeres 1 gene (POT1), with a proportion of family members presenting with an early age of onset and multiple primary tumors. We show that these variants either affect POT1 mRNA splicing or alter key residues in the highly conserved oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domains of POT1, disrupting protein-telomere binding and leading to increased telomere length. These findings suggest that POT1 variants predispose to melanoma formation via a direct effect on telomeres.},

abstract = {Malaria parasites secrete proteins across the vacuolar membrane into the erythrocyte, inducing modifications linked to disease and parasite survival. We identified an 11-amino acid signal required for the secretion of proteins from the Plasmodium falciparum vacuole to the human erythrocyte. Bioinformatics predicted a secretome of >320 proteins and conservation of the signal across parasite species. Functional studies indicated the predictive value of the signal and its role in targeting virulence proteins to the erythrocyte and implicated its recognition by a receptor/transporter. Erythrocyte modification by the parasite may involve plasmodial heat shock proteins and be vastly more complex than hitherto realized.},

abstract = {Pep1 is a 23-amino acid peptide that enhances resistance to a root pathogen, Pythium irregulare. Pep1 and its homologs (Pep2 to Pep7) are endogenous amplifiers of innate immunity of Arabidopsis thaliana that induce the transcription of defense-related genes and bind to PEPR1, a plasma membrane leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase. Here, we identify a plasma membrane LRR receptor kinase, designated PEPR2, that has 76\% amino acid similarity to PEPR1, and we characterize its role in the perception of Pep peptides and defense responses. Both PEPR1 and PEPR2 were transcriptionally induced by wounding, treatment with methyl jasmonate, Pep peptides, and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The effects of Pep1 application on defense-related gene induction and enhancement of resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 were partially reduced in single mutants of PEPR1 and PEPR2 and abolished completely in double mutants. Photoaffinity labeling and binding assays using transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells expressing PEPR1 and PEPR2 clearly demonstrated that PEPR1 is a receptor for Pep1-6 and that PEPR2 is a receptor for Pep1 and Pep2. Our analysis demonstrates differential binding affinities of two receptors with a family of peptide ligands and the corresponding physiological effects of the specific receptor-ligand interactions. Therefore, we demonstrate that, through perception of Peps, PEPR1 and PEPR2 contribute to defense responses in Arabidopsis.},

We used patterns of polymorphisms in functionally annotated regions in 1092 humans to identify deleterious variants; then we experimentally validated candidates. We analyzed both coding and noncoding regions, with the former corroborating the latter. We found regions particularly sensitive to mutations ("ultrasensitive") and variants that are disruptive because of mechanistic effects on transcription-factor binding (that is, "motif-breakers"). We also found variants in regions with higher network centrality tend to be deleterious. Insertions and deletions followed a similar pattern to single-nucleotide variants, with some notable exceptions (e.g., certain deletions and enhancers). On the basis of these patterns, we developed a computational tool (FunSeq), whose application to \~{}90 cancer genomes reveals nearly a hundred candidate noncoding drivers.},

BAK1 and BRI1 share similar gene expression and subcellular localization patterns and physically associate with each other in plants. Overexpression of the BAK1 gene leads to a phenotype reminiscent of BRI1-overexpression transgenic plants and rescues a weak bri1 mutant.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes.

RESULTS: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TransMap, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information.

AVAILABILITY: AUGUSTUS is open source and available at http://augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu).},

Although methods exist to detect and filter out cross-species contamination, few methods to detect within-species sample contamination are available. In this paper, we describe methods to identify within-species DNA sample contamination based on (1) a combination of sequencing reads and array-based genotype data, (2) sequence reads alone, and (3) array-based genotype data alone. Analysis of sequencing reads allows contamination detection after sequence data is generated but prior to variant calling; analysis of array-based genotype data allows contamination detection prior to generation of costly sequence data. Through a combination of analysis of in silico and experimentally contaminated samples, we show that our methods can reliably detect and estimate levels of contamination as low as 1\%. We evaluate the impact of DNA contamination on genotype accuracy and propose effective strategies to screen for and prevent DNA contamination in sequencing studies.},

abstract = {Recognition of pathogens by plants involves the coordinated efforts of molecular chaperones, disease resistance (R) proteins, and components of disease resistance signaling pathways. Characterization of events associated with pathogen perception in Arabidopsis thaliana has advanced understanding of molecular genetic mechanisms associated with disease resistance and protein interactions critical for the activation of resistance signaling. Regulation of R protein-mediated signaling in response to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis involves the physical association of at least two R proteins with the negative regulator RPM1 INTERACTING PROTEIN4 (RIN4). While the RIN4-RPS2 (for RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE2) and RIN4-RPM1 (for RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE PV MACULICOLA1) signaling pathways exhibit differential mechanisms of activation in terms of effector action, the requirement for NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1) is shared. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, followed by a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that the RIN4-NDR1 interaction occurs on the cytoplasmically localized N-terminal portion of NDR1 and that this interaction is required for the activation of resistance signaling following infection by P. syringae expressing the Cys protease Type III effector protein AvrRpt2. We demonstrate that like RPS2 and RPM1, NDR1 also associates with RIN4 in planta. We suggest that this interaction serves to further regulate activation of disease resistance signaling following recognition of P. syringae DC3000-AvrRpt2 by Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {Plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) function in diverse signaling pathways, including the responses to microbial signals in symbiosis and defense. This versatility is achieved with a common overall structure: an extracytoplasmic domain (ectodomain) and an intracellular protein kinase domain involved in downstream signal transduction. Various surfaces of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) ectodomain superstructure are utilized for interaction with the cognate ligand in both plant and animal receptors. RLKs with lysin-motif (LysM) ectodomains confer recognitional specificity toward N-acetylglucosamine-containing signaling molecules, such as chitin, peptidoglycan (PGN), and rhizobial nodulation factor (NF), that induce immune or symbiotic responses. Signaling downstream of RLKs does not follow a single pattern; instead, the detailed analysis of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, innate immunity, and symbiosis revealed at least three largely nonoverlapping pathways. In this review, we focus on RLKs involved in plant-microbe interactions and contrast the signaling pathways leading to symbiosis and defense.},

abstract = {Innate immunity in plants can be triggered by microbe- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) is often suppressed by pathogen effectors delivered into the host cell. Plants can overcome pathogen suppression of PTI and reestablish pathogen resistance through effector-triggered immunity (ETI). An unanswered question is how plants might overcome pathogen-suppression of PTI during ETI. Findings described in this paper suggest a possible mechanism. During Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection of Arabidopsis, a host ADP ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, AtMIN7, is destabilized by the pathogen effector HopM1 through the host 26S proteasome. In this study, we discovered that AtMIN7 is required for not only PTI, consistent with the notion that Pst DC3000 degrades AtMIN7 to suppress PTI, but also ETI. The AtMIN7 level in healthy plants is low, but increases posttranscriptionally in response to activation of PTI. Whereas DC3000 infection led to degradation of AtMIN7, activation of ETI by three different effectors, AvrRpt2, AvrPphB, and HopA1, in Col-0 plants blocks the ability of Pst DC3000 to destabilize AtMIN7. Further analyses of bacterial translocation of HopM1 and AtMIN7 stability in HopM1 transgenic plants show that ETI prevents HopM1-mediated degradation of AtMIN7 inside the plant cell. Both AtMIN7 and HopM1 are localized to the trans-Golgi network/early endosome, a subcellular compartment that is not previously known to be associated with bacterial pathogenesis in plants. Thus, blocking pathogen degradation of trans-Golgi network/early endosome-associated AtMIN7 is a critical part of the ETI mechanism to counter bacterial suppression of PTI.},

abstract = {Plants have sensitive perception systems that recognize various pathogen-derived molecules. We previously reported that rice detects flagellin from a rice-incompatible strain of gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium, Acidovorax avenae, which induces subsequent immune responses involving cell death. The mechanism of flagellin perception in rice, however, has remained obscure. In this study, we found that flg22, a peptide derived from the flagellin N-terminus, induced weak immune responses without cell death in cultured rice cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which flg22 induced signaling in rice, we characterized OsFLS2, the rice ortholog of AtFLS2, which mediates flg22 perception. Heterologous expression of OsFLS2 functions in Arabidopsis, showing the conservation of the flg22 signaling pathway across divergent plant taxa. OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin. However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice. These results suggest that rice possesses a conserved flagellin perception system utilizing the FLS2 receptor which, when upregulated, hardly affects resistance against compatible A. avenae.},

abstract = {Gastrin acts via cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptors to control histamine- and chromogranin A-producing ECL cells, which constitute the quantitatively predominant endocrine cell population in the acid-producing part of the rat stomach. Cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade is known to suppress the activity of ECL cells and to prevent their ability to respond to gastrin stimulation. The present study examines the reversibility of long-standing cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade of ECL cells. YM022, a potent and selective cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist, was administered in a maximally effective dose by continuous subcutaneous infusion for 4 weeks (via osmotic minipumps). The resulting receptor blockade was manifested in elevated serum gastrin concentration (due to the ensuing acid inhibition), while the serum pancreastatin concentration, oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity, histidine decarboxylase- and chromogranin A- mRNA levels and histamine and pancreastatin concentrations were lowered. After withdrawal of YM022, all these parameters returned to normal after varying lengths of time. The serum gastrin concentration and the oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity returned to normal within a week after termination of treatment. The serum pancreastatin concentration and the mucosal histidine decarboxylase- and chromogranin A-mRNA levels returned to normal within 2 weeks of drug withdrawal. The mucosal pancreastatin and histamine concentrations remained unchanged for about a week before gradually returning to control levels within the next two weeks. Hence, the various effects of cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade of the ECL cells are fully reversible within 1-3 weeks of drug withdrawal.},

abstract = {Genome assembly tools based on the de Bruijn graph framework rely on a parameter k, which represents a trade-off between several competing effects that are difficult to quantify. There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.   We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with a several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.

abstract = {Two modes of plant immunity against biotrophic pathogens, Effector Triggered Immunity (ETI) and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI), are triggered by recognition of pathogen effectors and Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs), respectively. Although the jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling sectors are generally antagonistic and important for immunity against necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens, respectively, their precise roles and interactions in ETI and PTI have not been clear. We constructed an Arabidopsis dde2/ein2/pad4/sid2-quadruple mutant. DDE2, EIN2, and SID2 are essential components of the JA, ET, and SA sectors, respectively. The pad4 mutation affects the SA sector and a poorly characterized sector. Although the ETI triggered by the bacterial effector AvrRpt2 (AvrRpt2-ETI) and the PTI triggered by the bacterial MAMP flg22 (flg22-PTI) were largely intact in plants with mutations in any one of these genes, they were mostly abolished in the quadruple mutant. For the purposes of this study, AvrRpt2-ETI and flg22-PTI were measured as relative growth of Pseudomonas syringae bacteria within leaves. Immunity to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola was also severely compromised in the quadruple mutant. Quantitative measurements of the immunity levels in all combinatorial mutants and wild type allowed us to estimate the effects of the wild-type genes and their interactions on the immunity by fitting a mixed general linear model. This signaling allocation analysis showed that, contrary to current ideas, each of the JA, ET, and SA signaling sectors can positively contribute to immunity against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. The analysis also revealed that while flg22-PTI and AvrRpt2-ETI use a highly overlapping signaling network, the way they use the common network is very different: synergistic relationships among the signaling sectors are evident in PTI, which may amplify the signal; compensatory relationships among the sectors dominate in ETI, explaining the robustness of ETI against genetic and pathogenic perturbations.},

@article{Beckers2009,
abstract = {In plants and animals, induced resistance (IR) to biotic and abiotic stress is associated with priming of cells for faster and stronger activation of defense responses. It has been hypothesized that cell priming involves accumulation of latent signaling components that are not used until challenge exposure to stress. However, the identity of such signaling components has remained elusive. Here, we show that during development of chemically induced resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, priming is associated with accumulation of mRNA and inactive proteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and MPK6. Upon challenge exposure to biotic or abiotic stress, these two enzymes were more strongly activated in primed plants than in nonprimed plants. This elevated activation was linked to enhanced defense gene expression and development of IR. Strong elicitation of stress-induced MPK3 and MPK6 activity is also seen in the constitutive priming mutant edr1, while activity was attenuated in the priming-deficient npr1 mutant. Moreover, priming of defense gene expression and IR were lost or reduced in mpk3 or mpk6 mutants. Our findings argue that prestress deposition of the signaling components MPK3 and MPK6 is a critical step in priming plants for full induction of defense responses during IR.},

abstract = {Aphanomyces euteiches is an oomycete pathogen that causes seedling blight and root rot of legumes, such as alfalfa and pea. The genus Aphanomyces is phylogenically distinct from well-studied oomycetes such as Phytophthora sp., and contains species pathogenic on plants and aquatic animals. To provide the first foray into gene diversity of A. euteiches, two cDNA libraries were constructed using mRNA extracted from mycelium grown in an artificial liquid medium or in contact to plant roots. A unigene set of 7,977 sequences was obtained from 18,864 high-quality expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) and characterized for potential functions. Comparisons with oomycete proteomes revealed major differences between the gene content of A. euteiches and those of Phytophthora species, leading to the identification of biosynthetic pathways absent in Phytophthora, of new putative pathogenicity genes and of expansion of gene families encoding extracellular proteins, notably different classes of proteases. Among the genes specific of A. euteiches are members of a new family of extracellular proteins putatively involved in adhesion, containing up to four protein domains similar to fungal cellulose binding domains. Comparison of A. euteiches sequences with proteomes of fully sequenced eukaryotic pathogens, including fungi, apicomplexa and trypanosomatids, allowed the identification of A. euteiches genes with close orthologs in these microorganisms but absent in other oomycetes sequenced so far, notably transporters and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, and suggests the presence of a defense mechanism against oxidative stress which was initially characterized in the pathogenic trypanosomatids.},

@article{Ruttenberg2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental goal of the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) "Roadmap" is to strengthen Translational Research, defined as the movement of discoveries in basic research to application at the clinical level. A significant barrier to translational research is the lack of uniformly structured data across related biomedical domains. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web that enables navigation and meaningful use of digital resources by automatic processes. It is based on common formats that support aggregation and integration of data drawn from diverse sources. A variety of technologies have been built on this foundation that, together, support identifying, representing, and reasoning across a wide range of biomedical data. The Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG), set up within the framework of the World Wide Web Consortium, was launched to explore the application of these technologies in a variety of areas. Subgroups focus on making biomedical data available in RDF, working with biomedical ontologies, prototyping clinical decision support systems, working on drug safety and efficacy communication, and supporting disease researchers navigating and annotating the large amount of potentially relevant literature.

RESULTS: We present a scenario that shows the value of the information environment the Semantic Web can support for aiding neuroscience researchers. We then report on several projects by members of the HCLSIG, in the process illustrating the range of Semantic Web technologies that have applications in areas of biomedicine.

CONCLUSION: Semantic Web technologies present both promise and challenges. Current tools and standards are already adequate to implement components of the bench-to-bedside vision. On the other hand, these technologies are young. Gaps in standards and implementations still exist and adoption is limited by typical problems with early technology, such as the need for a critical mass of practitioners and installed base, and growing pains as the technology is scaled up. Still, the potential of interoperable knowledge sources for biomedicine, at the scale of the World Wide Web, merits continued work.},

abstract = {The corn smut Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic interaction with its host plant maize. This interaction requires efficient suppression of plant immune responses, which is attributed to secreted effector proteins. Previously we identified Pep1 (Protein essential during penetration-1) as a secreted effector with an essential role for U. maydis virulence. pep1 deletion mutants induce strong defense responses leading to an early block in pathogenic development of the fungus. Using cytological and functional assays we show that Pep1 functions as an inhibitor of plant peroxidases. At sites of $\Delta$pep1 mutant penetrations, H₂O₂ strongly accumulated in the cell walls, coinciding with a transcriptional induction of the secreted maize peroxidase POX12. Pep1 protein effectively inhibited the peroxidase driven oxidative burst and thereby suppresses the early immune responses of maize. Moreover, Pep1 directly inhibits peroxidases in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Using fluorescence complementation assays, we observed a direct interaction of Pep1 and the maize peroxidase POX12 in vivo. Functional relevance of this interaction was demonstrated by partial complementation of the $\Delta$pep1 mutant defect by virus induced gene silencing of maize POX12. We conclude that Pep1 acts as a potent suppressor of early plant defenses by inhibition of peroxidase activity. Thus, it represents a novel strategy for establishing a biotrophic interaction.},

@article{Fauth1998,
abstract = {Hypocotyls from etiolated cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings were gently abraded at their epidermal surface and cut segments were conditioned to develop competence for H2O2 elicitation. Alkaline hydrolysates of cutin from cucumber, tomato, and apple elicited H2O2 in such conditioned segments. The most active constituent of cucumber cutin was identified as dodecan-1-ol, a novel cutin monomer capable of forming hydrophobic terminal chains. Additionally, the cutin hydrolysates enhanced the activity of a fungal H2O2 elicitor, similar to cucumber surface wax, which contained newly identified alkan-1,3-diols. The specificity of elicitor and enhancement activity was further elaborated using some pure model compounds. Certain saturated hydroxy fatty acids were potent H2O2 elicitors as well as enhancers. Some unsaturated epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids were also excellent H2O2 elicitors but inhibited the fungal elicitor activity. Short-chain alkanols exhibited good elicitor and enhancer activity, whereas longer-chain alkan-1-ols were barely active. The enhancement effect was also observed for H2O2 elicitation by ergosterol and chitosan. The physiological significance of these observations might be that once the cuticle is degraded by fungal cutinase, the cutin monomers may act as H2O2 elicitors. Corrosion of cutin may also bring surface wax constituents in contact with protoplasts and enhance elicitation.},

As evidenced throughout this review, NGS technologies will have a striking impact on genomic research and the entire biological field. With its ability to tackle the unsolved challenges unconquered by previous genomic technologies, NGS is likely to unravel the complexity of the human genome in terms of genetic variations, some of which may be confined to susceptible loci for some common human conditions.

The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74\%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85\%), and 25 of 77 (33\%) primary melanomas.

abstract = {Plants sense potential microbial invaders by using pattern-recognition receptors to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) (ref. 2) and elongation factor Tu receptor (EFR) (ref. 3) act as pattern-recognition receptors for the bacterial PAMPs flagellin and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (ref. 5) and contribute to resistance against bacterial pathogens. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link receptor activation to intracellular signal transduction. Here we show that BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that has been reported to regulate the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), is involved in signalling by FLS2 and EFR. Plants carrying bak1 mutations show normal flagellin binding but abnormal early and late flagellin-triggered responses, indicating that BAK1 acts as a positive regulator in signalling. The bak1-mutant plants also show a reduction in early, but not late, EF-Tu-triggered responses. The decrease in responses to PAMPs is not due to reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids. We provide evidence that FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex in vivo, in a specific ligand-dependent manner, within the first minutes of stimulation with flagellin. Thus, BAK1 is not only associated with developmental regulation through the plant hormone receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), but also has a functional role in PRR-dependent signalling, which initiates innate immunity.},

In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.},

abstract = {We report the analysis of a Japanese male using high-throughput sequencing to × 40 coverage. More than 99\% of the sequence reads were mapped to the reference human genome. Using a Bayesian decision method, we identified 3,132,608 single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Comparison with six previously reported genomes revealed an excess of singleton nonsense and nonsynonymous SNVs, as well as singleton SNVs in conserved non-coding regions. We also identified 5,319 deletions smaller than 10 kb with high accuracy, in addition to copy number variations and rearrangements. De novo assembly of the unmapped sequence reads generated around 3 Mb of novel sequence, which showed high similarity to non-reference human genomes and the human herpesvirus 4 genome. Our analysis suggests that considerable variation remains undiscovered in the human genome and that whole-genome sequencing is an invaluable tool for obtaining a complete understanding of human genetic variation.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

We identified cytosolic heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone, as another RAR1 interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. RAR1 interacts with the N-terminal half of HSP90 that contains the ATPase domain. HSP90 also specifically interacts with SGT1 that contains a tetratricopeptide repeat motif and a domain with similarity to the cochaperone p23. In Arabidopsis, the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin reduces the hypersensitive response and abolishes resistance triggered by the R protein RPS2 against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (avrRpt2). One of four Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP90 isoforms, AtHSP90.1 is required for full RPS2 resistance and is rapidly induced upon pathogen challenge. We propose that RAR1 and SGT1 function closely with HSP90 in chaperoning roles that are essential for disease resistance.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies have strongly impacted microbiology, providing a rapid and cost-effective way of generating draft genomes and exploring microbial diversity. However, sequences obtained from impure nucleic acid preparations may contain DNA from sources other than the sample. Those sequence contaminations are a serious concern to the quality of the data used for downstream analysis, causing misassembly of sequence contigs and erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the removal of sequence contaminants is a necessary and required step for all sequencing projects. We developed DeconSeq, a robust framework for the rapid, automated identification and removal of sequence contamination in longer-read datasets (150 bp mean read length). DeconSeq is publicly available as standalone and web-based versions. The results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases used for the web-based version are automatically updated on a regular basis. DeconSeq categorizes possible contamination sequences, eliminates redundant hits with higher similarity to non-contaminant genomes, and provides graphical visualizations of the alignment results and classifications. Using DeconSeq, we conducted an analysis of possible human DNA contamination in 202 previously published microbial and viral metagenomes and found possible contamination in 145 (72\%) metagenomes with as high as 64\% contaminating sequences. This new framework allows scientists to automatically detect and efficiently remove unwanted sequence contamination from their datasets while eliminating critical limitations of current methods. DeconSeq's web interface is simple and user-friendly. The standalone version allows offline analysis and integration into existing data processing pipelines. DeconSeq's results reveal whether the sequencing experiment has succeeded, whether the correct sample was sequenced, and whether the sample contains any sequence contamination from DNA preparation or host. In addition, the analysis of 202 metagenomes demonstrated significant contamination of the non-human associated metagenomes, suggesting that this method is appropriate for screening all metagenomes. DeconSeq is available at http://deconseq.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When using Illumina high throughput short read data, sometimes the genotype inferred from the positive strand and negative strand are significantly different, with one homozygous and the other heterozygous. This phenomenon is known as strand bias. In this study, we used Illumina short-read sequencing data to evaluate the effect of strand bias on genotyping quality, and to explore the possible causes of strand bias.

RESULT: We collected 22 breast cancer samples from 22 patients and sequenced their exome using the Illumina GAIIx machine. By comparing the consistency between the genotypes inferred from this sequencing data with the genotypes inferred from SNP chip data, we found that, when using sequencing data, SNPs with extreme strand bias did not have significantly lower consistency rates compared to SNPs with low or no strand bias. However, this result may be limited by the small subset of SNPs present in both the exome sequencing and the SNP chip data. We further compared the transition and transversion ratio and the number of novel non-synonymous SNPs between the SNPs with low or no strand bias and those with extreme strand bias, and found that SNPs with low or no strand bias have better overall quality. We also discovered that the strand bias occurs randomly at genomic positions across these samples, and observed no consistent pattern of strand bias location across samples. By comparing results from two different aligners, BWA and Bowtie, we found very consistent strand bias patterns. Thus strand bias is unlikely to be caused by alignment artifacts. We successfully replicated our results using two additional independent datasets with different capturing methods and Illumina sequencers.

CONCLUSION: Extreme strand bias indicates a potential high false-positive rate for SNPs.},

@article{Funke2006,
abstract = {The engineering of transgenic crops resistant to the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate has greatly improved agricultural efficiency worldwide. Glyphosate-based herbicides, such as Roundup, target the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, the functionality of which is absolutely required for the survival of plants. Roundup Ready plants carry the gene coding for a glyphosate-insensitive form of this enzyme, obtained from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4. Once incorporated into the plant genome, the gene product, CP4 EPSP synthase, confers crop resistance to glyphosate. Although widely used, the molecular basis for this glyphosate-resistance has remained obscure. We generated a synthetic gene coding for CP4 EPSP synthase and characterized the enzyme using kinetics and crystallography. The CP4 enzyme has unexpected kinetic and structural properties that render it unique among the known EPSP synthases. Glyphosate binds to the CP4 EPSP synthase in a condensed, noninhibitory conformation. Glyphosate sensitivity can be restored through a single-site mutation in the active site (Ala-100-Gly), allowing glyphosate to bind in its extended, inhibitory conformation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.

RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

abstract = {In this study, we analyzed all known protein sequences for repeating amino acid segments. Although duplicated sequence segments occur in 14 \% of all proteins, eukaryotic proteins are three times more likely to have internal repeats than prokaryotic proteins. After clustering the repetitive sequence segments into families, we find repeats from eukaryotic proteins have little similarity with prokaryotic repeats, suggesting most repeats arose after the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages diverged. Consequently, protein classes with the highest incidence of repetitive sequences perform functions unique to eukaryotes. The frequency distribution of the repeating units shows only weak length dependence, implicating recombination rather than duplex melting or DNA hairpin formation as the limiting mechanism underlying repeat formation. The mechanism favors additional repeats once an initial duplication has been incorporated. Finally, we show that repetitive sequences are favored that contain small and relatively water-soluble residues. We propose that error-prone repeat expansion allows repetitive proteins to evolve more quickly than non-repeat-containing proteins.},

abstract = {We recently identified a novel gene that is negatively regulated by extracellular calcium concentration with higher levels of transcripts in hypertensive animals (SHR). We named this gene HCaRG (Hypertension-related, Calcium-Regulated Gene). In this work we report the chromosomal localization of the HCaRG gene among different species. We identified a BglII RFLP between BN.lx and SHR rats. We then analysed the strain distribution pattern of this RFLP in 31 RIS, originating from BN.lx and SHR rats, and compared it to the segregation of 475 markers localized in the rat genetic map. Hcarg localizes to the rat chromosome 7 between the markers Mit3 and Mit4. This region is homologous to human chromosome 8q21-24. We identified three clones in Genbank that contain the sequence of HCaRG. It was therefore possible to narrow down the localization of human HCaRG to chromosome 8q24.3. Furthermore, a suggestive localization of mouse Hcarg based on conservation of linkage between human and mouse is on chromosome 15. We previously identified a putative calcium-binding motif (EF-Hand) and a nuclear receptor-binding domain (LxxLL) in the rat sequence of the HCaRG protein. Sequence comparison between five different species showed that these domains are highly conserved. Furthermore, a search of ESTs in Genbank for homologous sequences showed that HCaRG is expressed only in eukaryotes, particularly in mammals.},

abstract = {Plants and animals use innate immunity as a first defense against pathogens, a costly yet necessary tradeoff between growth and immunity. In Arabidopsis, the regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 combines with the LRR-RLKs FLS2 and EFR in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and the LRR-RLK BRI1 in brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth. Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin. Our results suggest a general mechanism operative in plants in which BR-mediated growth directly antagonizes innate immune signaling.},

abstract = {The fungal biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum has been recently shown to induce systemic resistance in plants through a mechanism that employs jasmonic acid and ethylene signal transduction pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins have been implicated in the signal transduction of a wide variety of plant stress responses. Here we report the identification and characterization of a Trichoderma-induced MAPK (TIPK) gene function in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Similar to its homologs, wound-induced protein kinase, MPK3, and MPK3a, TIPK is also induced by wounding. Normally, preinoculation of roots with Trichoderma activates plant defense mechanisms, which result in resistance to the leaf pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv lachrymans. We used a unique attenuated virus vector, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV-AGII), to overexpress TIPK protein and antisense (AS) RNA. Plants overexpressing TIPK were more resistant to pathogenic bacterial attack than control plants, even in the absence of Trichoderma preinoculation. On the other hand, plants expressing TIPK-AS revealed increased sensitivity to pathogen attack. Moreover, Trichoderma preinoculation could not protect these AS plants against subsequent pathogen attack. We therefore demonstrate that Trichoderma exerts its protective effect on plants through activation of the TIPK gene, a MAPK that is involved in signal transduction pathways of defense responses.},

abstract = {The battle between phytopathogenic bacteria and their plant hosts has revealed a diverse suite of strategies and mechanisms employed by the pathogen or the host to gain the higher ground. Pathogens continually evolve tactics to acquire host resources and dampen host defences. Hosts must evolve surveillance and defence systems that are sensitive enough to rapidly respond to a diverse range of pathogens, while reducing costly and damaging inappropriate misexpression. The primary virulence mechanism employed by many bacteria is the type III secretion system, which secretes and translocates effector proteins directly into the cells of their plant hosts. Effectors have diverse enzymatic functions and can target specific components of plant systems. While these effectors should favour bacterial fitness, the host may be able to thwart infection by recognizing the activity or presence of these foreign molecules and initiating retaliatory immune measures. We review the diverse host cellular systems exploited by bacterial effectors, with particular focus on plant proteins directly targeted by effectors. Effector-host interactions reveal different stages of the battle between pathogen and host, as well as the diverse molecular strategies employed by bacterial pathogens to hijack eukaryotic cellular systems.},

With the use of differential display, a transcript was found in SHR myocardium that on sequence analysis was identified as an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). ERV gene expression was greater than an order of magnitude increased in adult SHR hearts relative to age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and was further increased in hearts from SHR with heart failure. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that increased ERV gene expression was localized to myocardial cells. Increases in ERV transcripts in SHR suggest a possible link between inherited proviral elements and genetic hypertensive heart disease.},

abstract = {The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae injects effector proteins into host cells through a type III protein secretion system to cause disease. The enzymatic activities of most of P. syringae effectors and their targets remain obscure. Here we show that the type III effector HopU1 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADP-RT). HopU1 suppresses plant innate immunity in a manner dependent on its ADP-RT active site. The HopU1 substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana extracts were RNA-binding proteins that possess RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs). A. thaliana knockout lines defective in the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein GRP7 (also known as AtGRP7), a HopU1 substrate, were more susceptible than wild-type plants to P. syringae. The ADP-ribosylation of GRP7 by HopU1 required two arginines within the RRM, indicating that this modification may interfere with GRP7's ability to bind RNA. Our results suggest a pathogenic strategy where the ADP-ribosylation of RNA-binding proteins quells host immunity by affecting RNA metabolism and the plant defence transcriptome.},

Additionally, the inverted H2 form of 17q21.31 seems to be positively selected in Europeans. We developed a population genetics approach to analyze complex genome structures and identified nine segregating structural forms of 17q21.31. Both the H1 and H2 forms of the 17q21.31 inversion polymorphism contain independently derived, partial duplications of the KANSL1 gene; these duplications, which produce novel KANSL1 transcripts, have both recently risen to high allele frequencies (26\% and 19\%) in Europeans. An older H2 form lacking such a duplication is present at low frequency in European and central African hunter-gatherer populations. We further show that complex genome structures can be analyzed by imputation from SNPs.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to function as second messengers in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells. However, the question whether ROS production is indeed required for ABA signal transduction in vivo has not yet been addressed, and the molecular mechanisms mediating ROS production during ABA signaling remain unknown. Here, we report identification of two partially redundant Arabidopsis guard cell-expressed NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit genes, AtrbohD and AtrbohF, in which gene disruption impairs ABA signaling. atrbohD/F double mutations impair ABA-induced stomatal closing, ABA promotion of ROS production, ABA-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) increases and ABA- activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels in guard cells. Exogenous H(2)O(2) rescues both Ca(2+) channel activation and stomatal closing in atrbohD/F. ABA inhibition of seed germination and root elongation are impaired in atrbohD/F, suggesting more general roles for ROS and NADPH oxidases in ABA signaling. These data provide direct molecular genetic and cell biological evidence that ROS are rate-limiting second messengers in ABA signaling, and that the AtrbohD and AtrbohF NADPH oxidases function in guard cell ABA signal transduction.},

abstract = {SINEs are retrotransposons that have enjoyed remarkable reproductive success during the course of mammalian evolution, and have played a major role in shaping mammalian genomes. Previously, an analysis of survey-sequence data from an individual dog (a poodle) indicated that canine genomes harbor a high frequency of alleles that differ only by the absence or presence of a SINEC\_Cf repeat. Comparison of this survey-sequence data with a draft genome sequence of a distinct dog (a boxer) has confirmed this prediction, and revealed the chromosomal coordinates for >10,000 loci that are bimorphic for SINEC\_Cf insertions. Analysis of SINE insertion sites from the genomes of nine additional dogs indicates that 3\%-5\% are absent from either the poodle or boxer genome sequences--suggesting that an additional 10,000 bimorphic loci could be readily identified in the general dog population. We describe a methodology that can be used to identify these loci, and could be adapted to exploit these bimorphic loci for genotyping purposes. Approximately half of all annotated canine genes contain SINEC\_Cf repeats, and these elements are occasionally transcribed. When transcribed in the antisense orientation, they provide splice acceptor sites that can result in incorporation of novel exons. The high frequency of bimorphic SINE insertions in the dog population is predicted to provide numerous examples of allele-specific transcription patterns that will be valuable for the study of differential gene expression among multiple dog breeds.},

Some of the groups also include members from hosts which were not previously known to harbor betaretroviruses, such as the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata). Some of the mouse and rat elements possess intact open reading frames for gag, pro, pol, and/or env genes and display characteristics of having retrotransposed recently.

abstract = {Unmapped reads are often discarded from the analysis of whole genome re-sequencing, while, opposingly, new biological information can be discovered from their analysis. In this pa- per, we investigated these reads from the re-sequencing data of thirty-three aphid genomes. The unmapped reads for each individual were retrieved from the results of the mapping of the sets of reads against the Acyrthosyphon Pisum reference genome, its mitochondrion genome and several known or putative symbiont genomes. These sets of unmapped reads were then cross-compared, this pointed out that a significant number of these sequences were conserved among individuals, especially when the latter are adapted to a same specific host plant, revealing that they may share crucial and functional material. Moreover, the analysis of the contigs resulting from the assem- blies of the unmapped reads gathered by biotype allowed us to discover putative novel sequences absent from the reference genomes and highlighted the possible presence of other symbionts in the pea aphid genome whose existence were not known previously. As a conclusion, this study emphasizes that using a default strategy (e.g for the mapping) may lead to the loss of important information, and must be accompanied by specific analyses depending on the biological model.},

abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

@article{Sachs1997,
abstract = {The regulation of gastric acid secretion is achieved in the periphery by interplay between three major gastric endocrine cells: the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell, the gastrin or G cell, and the somatostatin or D cell. Regulation of these cells is via stimulatory or inhibitory paracrine, endocrine, and neural pathways. Upregulation of ECL function is determined by activation of CCK-B receptors, by gastrin, and by activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as by acetylcholine in some (10-29\%) of the cells. Gastrin and acetylcholine produce typical biphasic calcium signals. Inhibition of ECL cell histamine release and calcium signaling is produced by somatostatin acting at a type 2 receptor, histamine acting at a histamine-3 receptor, and by peptide PYY. Stimulation of ECL cells results in activation of chloride channels, and there is evidence that voltage-dependent calcium channels, along with the receptor-operated calcium channels, also are responsible for elevation of [Ca]i. Depolarization-activated K+ channels presumably restore the potential after depolarization by activation of the chloride channel. The D cell is activated by either gastrin or CCK and appears to be inhibited by acetylcholine and somatostatin. The G cell is activated by acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and is inhibited by somatostatin. The functional integration of these three cell types is the primary determinant of the degree of stimulation of the parietal cell.},

abstract = {Assessing relevant molecular differences between human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is important, given that such differences may impact their potential therapeutic use. Controversy surrounds recent gene expression studies comparing hiPSCs and hESCs. Here, we present an in-depth quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis of hESCs, two different hiPSCs and their precursor fibroblast cell lines. Our comparisons confirmed the high similarity of hESCs and hiPSCS at the proteome level as 97.8\% of the proteins were found unchanged. Nevertheless, a small group of 58 proteins, mainly related to metabolism, antigen processing and cell adhesion, was found significantly differentially expressed between hiPSCs and hESCs. A comparison of the regulated proteins with previously published transcriptomic studies showed a low overlap, highlighting the emerging notion that differences between both pluripotent cell lines rather reflect experimental conditions than a recurrent molecular signature.},
